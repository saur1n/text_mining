Promoters and enhancers—key controllers of gene expression—have long been distinguished
from each other based on their function. However, recent work suggested that common
architectural and functional features might have facilitated the conversion of one type
of element into the other during evolution. Here, based on cross-mammalian analyses
of epigenome and transcriptome data, we provide support for this hypothesis by detecting
445 regulatory elements with signatures of activity turnover (termed P/E elements). Most
events represent transformations of putative ancestral enhancers into promoters, leading
to the emergence of species-specific transcribed loci or 5′ exons. Distinct GC sequence
compositions and stabilizing 5′ splicing (U1) regulatory motif patterns may have predisposed
P/E elements to regulatory repurposing, and changes in the U1 and polyadenylation signal
densities and distributions likely drove the evolutionary activity switches. Our work suggests
that regulatory repurposing facilitated regulatory innovation and the origination of new genes
and exons during evolution.

Gene transcription in mammals is controlled by the interactions
between proximal and distal gene regulatory
elements. Promoters—the proximal regulatory regions
associated with the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene—
mediate the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
through their recognition by general transcription factors1. The
spatiotemporal activation of gene expression is further defined by
transcription factors bound to other regulatory loci, including
TSS-distal enhancers2,3. Several sequence and structural features
characterize promoters and enhancers. Most vertebrate promoters
are CpG-rich1, while most enhancers are CpG-poor4, a
difference that is also reflected in the respective regulatory motif
compositions5,6. While both types of elements are characterized
by accessible chromatin7, enhancers and promoters have different
chromatin modification profiles. Promoters are generally associated
with higher levels of trimethylation of lysine 4 at histone 3
(H3K4me3) compared to monomethylation of the same residue
(H3K4me1); whereas, the opposite pattern is found for enhancers
in a poised state8. However, both types of elements are enriched
for acetylation of lysine 27 at histone 3 (H3K27ac) when
active9,10.
Although the aforementioned features led to the distinction
of promoters and enhancers as different types of regulatory elements,
recent work unveiled similarities in their architecture
and activity (reviewed in refs. 11–13). Transcriptome analyses
revealed that both promoters and enhancers are bidirectionally
transcribed4,14,15, and that this process involves the recruitment
of the same transcriptional machinery16. Moreover, some regulatory
elements display similar chromatin modification profiles
despite different activities; for example, enrichment of H3K4me3
can also be detected at highly transcribed enhancers17. The two
classes of regulatory elements may also show bivalent functionality,
with some enhancers acting as alternative promoters18 and
some promoters enhancing the expression of other genes19–21.
Although these observations blurred the boundary between the
two classes of regulatory regions, the association of promoters
to long transcripts that are 5′ capped and 3′ polyadenylated still
distinguishes these regulatory elements from enhancers, which
produce short, generally unstable transcripts4.
Transcript stability has been linked to the relative enrichment
of destabilizing polyadenylation signals (PAS) and stabilizing 5′
splicing (U1) motifs downstream of the TSS. U1 sites, apart from
their role in splicing, prevent premature transcript cleavage from
cryptic PAS through their binding with the U1 snRNP22. Polyadenylation
signals proximal to the TSS have the opposite effect,
and direct nascent transcripts towards exosome degradation23.
Unidirectional promoters show an enrichment of U1 sites and
a depletion of PAS sites in their sense direction relative to their
upstream antisense direction, which supposedly limits pervasive
genome transcription24. The instability of enhancer-associated
transcripts is also due to an enrichment of PAS over U1 motifs17.
Given the structural and functional similarities between
enhancers and promoters, changes in the U1-PAS axis might in
principle alter the activity of these regulatory elements. Inheritable
mutations at PAS and U1 sites might stabilize enhancerassociated
transcripts, thus facilitating their evolution into promoters25.
Similarly, mutations might destabilize promoter transcription,
but not affect the ability of these loci to regulate the
expression of other genes. Thus, one might expect to observe
orthologous regulatory elements that function as enhancers in
one species but as promoters in another. Interestingly, recent
work reported the frequent evolutionary emergence and decay
of enhancers26 and, at a lower rate, promoters27 in mammals.
Although, the gain- and loss-of-regulatory elements is largely
driven by the insertion and deletion of genomic sequences, such
as repetitive elements26,28, many regions align to orthologous loci
in other species not showing the same functionality26,27. This
raises the possibility that some regulatory elements might
experience changes in their activity during evolution—a process
we refer to as regulatory repurposing.
Suggestive evidence for the existence of regulatory repurposing
events has been reported in mammals. We recently described
an enrichment of enhancer-associated chromatin marks at
mouse loci orthologous to the promoters of new rat-specific
mRNA-derived gene duplicates (retrocopies)29. Moreover, two
separate studies reported evidence of 11 mouse long-non-coding
RNAs whose promoter sequences were orthologous to putative
human enhancers30,31. Nonetheless, a thorough investigation of
the prevalence of regulatory repurposing during mammalian
evolution and its underlying molecular mechanisms has been
lacking.
Here we report a detailed survey of regulatory repurposing in
mammals. Based on integrated evolutionary analyses of mammalian
chromatin profiles and transcriptional data, we detect 445
repurposed elements in sister species from the primate and
rodent lineages. In most cases, putative ancestral enhancers were
converted to promoters during evolution. This observation suggests
that enhancers might have a higher repurposing potential
than promoters. Enhancer-to-promoter transformations led to
the origination of species-specific transcribed loci or 5′ exons.
We also find that distinct GC sequence compositions and stabilizing
5′ splicing (U1) regulatory motif patterns may have predisposed
P/E elements to regulatory repurposing, and that
changes in the U1 and polyadenylation signal densities and distributions
likely underlie the evolutionary activity alterations.
Overall, our work highlights regulatory repurposing as a notable
mechanism that likely facilitated regulatory innovation and the
origination of new genes and exons during mammalian evolution.
Results
Regulatory element repurposing in primates and rodents. As
only limited evidence of putative regulatory repurposing was
available from previous studies, we first sought to confirm its
occurrence and study its prevalence in mammals. Toward this
aim, we defined genome-wide sets of putative enhancers in a
mammalian reference species and investigated whether any of
these loci were orthologous to putative promoter regions from
a closely related species (Fig. 1a) and hence represented candidate
repurposed elements—here referred to as P/E elements. We
focused our work on four species from two mammalian orders:
human and rhesus macaque, as representatives of the primate
lineage, and mouse and rat from the rodent lineage. We chose
these two species pairs for several reasons: first, a large amount
of gene expression and chromatin modification data is publicly
available for human and mouse, allowing for the annotation of
comprehensive sets of regulatory elements based on various tissues
and developmental stages. Second, the relatively short evolutionary
divergence times (25–29 millions of years) between
human/mouse and macaque/rat, respectively, facilitates the definition
of high confidence orthologous regions for each species
pair, thus enabling the comparison of regulatory activities for
large numbers of genomic loci. Third, suitable outgroup
species (marmoset for the two primates and rabbit for the
rodents) with relevant data are available for evolutionary inferences.
Finally, both species sets have respective advantages and
disadvantages, and therefore the analyses of both datasets allow
for overall optimal analyses. For example, while the low mutation
rate and resulting high sequence similarity in the primates
may allow for higher confidence inferences of early regulatory
element evolution, the larger rodent sequence divergence and
more efficient natural selection during rodent evolution may

allow for easier and/or more powerful detection of regulatory
repurposing events.
We defined sets of putative promoters as the upstream regions
of stably transcribed loci, assembled using both our newly
generated as well as recently published32 strand-specific RNA-seq
data from four organs (brain, heart, kidney, and liver; see
Methods) (Supplementary Data 1–2), which yielded between
27,042 and 33,520 promoters for each species (Supplementary
Data 3). We then identified putative enhancers in human and
mouse (i.e., our reference species for which extensive relevant
data are available—see above) by combining transcription, DNase
hypersensitivity and histone modification data from the same
set of organs. Specifically, we extracted all DNase hypersensitive
sites enriched for H3K4me1 and/or H3K27ac in any of the four
organs, and filtered out those regions which showed signatures
of promoter activity in any sample from a broad set of tissues
and cell types (see Methods). This was done to limit the inclusion
of potential bivalent elements (i.e., elements characterized by
both enhancer and promoter activity in different tissues of the
same organism), which would hamper our search for bona fide
repurposed elements. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some
putative enhancers might have promoter activity in other tissues
or developmental stages. Additionally, we included a second set of
putative enhancers, defined using CAGE data from a number
of organs and cell lines in human and mouse4, which was
further filtered for bivalent elements. Overall, we obtained a highconfidence
set of 110,611 putative enhancers (hereafter simply
termed enhancers) in human and 127,145 in mouse (Supplementary
Data 4).
Functional remodeling facilitated regulatory innovation. After
the annotation of putative regulatory regions in our set of species,
we assessed the evolutionary conservation of their activity to
detect P/E elements. Specifically, we extracted 97,451 human and
105,700 mouse enhancers that could be aligned to orthologous
sequences in their sister species. We then investigated whether the
orthologous loci in the macaque or rat genome, respectively,
overlapped the promoter region of a stable transcript (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Data 5). After removal of putative false positives
associated to short transcript isoforms (46 in primates, 60 in
rodents, see Methods), we thus identified 184 P/E elements in
primates and 261 elements in rodents (i.e., 445 in total). We
subdivided the P/E elements into two distinct categories based on
their association to a species-specific (i.e., macaque- or rat-specific)
transcribed locus (novel P/E) or to a new species-specific 5′
exon of a locus transcribed in both species of the respective
lineage pair (extended P/E) (Fig. 1b, c, Supplementary Data 6). To
further confirm the promoter activity of P/E elements in macaque
and rat, we inspected their chromatin state using publicly available
H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from adult liver samples26. Consistent
with the notion of regulatory repurposing, P/E elements
associated with stable liver transcripts in macaque and rat display
higher H3K4me3 coverage compared to sequences orthologous to
non-repurposed liver enhancers in human or mouse, respectively
(Fig. 1d). H3K4me3 levels at novel and extended P/E elements in
macaque and rat are significantly lower compared to those
measured at stable liver promoters conserved in their sister species
(Fig. 1d), likely reflecting the lower expression level of
P/E-associated transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our analysis

thus uncovered the presence of hundreds of P/E elements
showing divergent regulatory activities in two major mammalian
lineages. Notably, a sequence conservation analysis reveals that
the sets of P/E elements overall show signatures of selective
preservation (Supplementary Fig. 2), which suggests that at least
subsets of them have acted as functional regulators at least during
some time of their evolutionary history.
The detection of P/E elements in two closely related species
could in principle result from the independent de novo evolution
of distinct activities from an ancestral inactive region, rather than
from a species-specific repurposing of an ancestral regulatory
region. We therefore investigated whether the enhancer signature
detected at a specific locus would significantly increase the chance
of observing promoter activity at the orthologous locus in the
closely related species, which would support the repurposing
scenario. We defined control regions showing no signature of
regulatory activity and no overlap with any exonic sequence in
human and mouse (Methods section) and then evaluated whether
their orthologous regions in the sister species were associated to
the TSS of a stable transcript. Only 0.04% (79/181,688) of the
control regions tested in primates and 0.02% (23/83,288) of those
in rodents show this behavior. These percentages are significantly
lower compared to the fraction of P/E elements retrieved in
primates (0.18%, 184/97,405 elements; >4.03-fold enrichment for
novel or extended P/E loci, Fisher’s exact test, P < 10−9) and
rodents (0.24%, 261/105,640 elements; >7.81-fold enrichment,
Fisher’s exact test, P < 10−8) (Fig. 1e). Although there is a
difference in GC content between the inactive regions and the
putative enhancers tested in both species (Supplementary Fig. 3),
rat- and macaque-specific promoters are nonetheless more
often orthologous to enhancers than to inactive loci with matched
sequence composition in their sister species (Supplementary
Fig. 4). These data corroborate the hypothesis that P/E elements
likely correspond to ancestral regulatory regions that experienced
evolutionary changes in their regulatory activity in the last 25–29
millions of years. Ancestral regulatory capacities of genomic
sequences therefore facilitated regulatory innovation in mammals,
while our analyses also suggest that a sizeable number of
lineage-specific regulatory elements may have emerged de novo
from the large inactive portion of the genome.
Enhancers are the main source of regulatory repurposing. The
retrieval of hundreds of lineage-specific P/E elements allowed us
to investigate at a broad scale the directionality of regulatory
activity changes; that is, to define whether an ancestral enhancer
evolved into a promoter, or vice versa. We thus investigated the
presence of regulatory activity associated to regions orthologous
to P/E elements in an outgroup species, in order to infer their
ancestral state. Using ChIP-seq and transcription data to annotate
putative regulatory elements in adult marmoset liver26, we find
that 40.9% (27 of 66) primate P/E elements with activity in liver
and aligned to the marmoset genome correspond to orthologous
putative enhancers in this outgroup species, whereas only 1.5%
overlap a promoter (Table 1). Similarly, 34.7% of rodent P/E
elements correspond to putative enhancers in rabbit, while only
2% overlap a promoter (Fig. 2a, Table 1). The higher fraction of
ancestral P/E elements with enhancer activity suggests that most
repurposed elements correspond to ancestral enhancers that
recently evolved species-specific promoter activities.
Our analysis also revealed that 38 (57.6%) and 31 (63.3%) P/E
elements active in liver in primates and rodents, respectively,
do not bear any signature of liver activity in the outgroup species.
We therefore reasoned that some P/E elements might be active
in a different organ in the outgroup. To evaluate this possibility,
we determined the fraction of primate and rodent P/E elements
orthologous to a promoter in any of the adult organs investigated
in marmoset and rabbit. This analysis shows that only 8 of
the 174 marmoset regions orthologous to a primate P/E element
(4.5%) overlap the TSS of a transcript and therefore likely
correspond to an ancestral promoter. A similarly low fraction
(5/134, 3.7%) of rodent P/E elements correspond to promoters
in rabbit. These results further confirm that only a limited
number of detected repurposing events involved ancestral
promoter elements.
Recent work reported a higher evolutionary turnover of
enhancers compared to promoters in mammals26. To evaluate
whether this bias could explain the observed higher enhancer-topromoter
repurposing rate, we compared the rates of repurposing
and loss of activity for ancestral liver enhancers and promoters in
both lineages (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 1; Methods). The rate
of enhancer loss (≈50.5%, 2655 of 5260 ancestral enhancers) is
~1.92 times higher than that of promoter loss (≈26.3%, 1342 of
5110 ancestral promoters), in agreement with previous observations26.
Notably, however, the rate of ancestral enhancer
repurposing (≈0.51%, 27/5260) was ~26 times higher than that
of ancestral promoter repurposing (≈0.02%, 1/5110). This pattern
corresponds to an ~13-fold enrichment of enhancer repurposing
relative to promoter repurposing (Fisher’s exact test, P < 10−3;
Table 2), taking the increased enhancer loss rate into account.
The lack of a statistically significant similar pattern in rodents
(≈6-fold enrichment, Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.056; Table 2) is
likely due to lack of power and explained by evolutionary
differences between the primate and glires (the clade including
rodents and lagomorphs) species investigated. That is, the
considerably larger divergence time of the glires species
(divergence time: ≈80 million years between mouse/rat and
rabbit) compared to that in primates (≈42 million years between
human/macaque and marmoset), their higher mutation rates, and
the more efficient natural selection in glires may obscure actual
rates of activity turnover in this lineage. In any event, our primate
analyses suggest that the higher rate of enhancer repurposing
cannot be explained by the higher turnover rate of enhancers
compared to promoters, although future work on additional
closely related sets of species and organs will be needed to
confirm this pattern.
P/E elements have distinct sequence compositions. Large-scale
surveys have demonstrated that the motif and sequence composition
of mammalian enhancers closely resembles that of promoter
regions that do not overlap with CpG islands (CGIs), but
differences between distinct types of enhancers have been
reported4. Due to the peculiar evolutionary change in activity of
P/E elements, we therefore investigated whether their sequence
would be distinct relative to other regulatory regions. P/E
enhancers in both human and mouse have an overall lower GC

and CpG content when compared with CGI-associated promoters
(Fig. 3a–d), in agreement with known differences between CpG
islands and enhancers4. Surprisingly, P/E enhancers have a significantly
higher GC content compared to other enhancers and,
to a lower extent, non-CGI-associated promoters, indicating that
the sequence composition distinguishes P/E enhancers from
other regulatory sequences (Fig. 3a, b). Similarly, there is a higher
content of the CpG dinucleotide in P/E enhancers compared to
other enhancers but not to non-CGI promoters (Fig. 3c, d),
reinforcing the distinction of this class of regulatory elements
from other enhancer elements. We also find that P/E promoters
in macaque and rat have significantly higher GC and CpG content
than macaque/rat sequences orthologous to enhancers in
human/mouse (Supplementary Fig. 5), although, we note that a
large number of these orthologous loci might be inactive in
macaque and rat. Small or no differences in GC and CpG content
were instead evident between P/E elements and non-CGI promoters
in macaque and rat (Supplementary Fig. 5). The overall
differences in sequence composition between P/E elements and
other regulatory regions are also reflected in their relative
enrichment for core promoter-associated motifs with different
GC contents (Supplementary Data 7). Taken together, these
results highlight how the sequence and motif composition of P/E
elements distinguishes them from other regulatory elements.
Sequence compositional changes associated with repurposing.
Next, we sought to trace whether compositional changes may
underlie functional shifts of P/E elements. Notably, the CpG
content of regulatory elements has been proposed to influence
their transcriptional output33,34. CpG islands are usually associated
to the promoter of broadly and highly expressed genes1,
where they favor gene expression by creating a nucleosome-free
environment33,34. We therefore asked whether P/E elements with

promoter activity were associated to higher GC and CpG contents
compared to their orthologous regions. Importantly, the genomewide
sequence composition—and particularly the GC content—
can vary even between closely related species35. In this case, any
difference observed between orthologous P/E elements should be
compared to the global change in sequence composition experienced
by the two species, using regions not subject to natural
selection. To do so, we compared the difference in GC and CpG
frequencies between orthologous P/E elements with that observed
between orthologous inactive regions. We found that rat P/E
promoters showed somewhat higher GC content compared to
their orthologous mouse P/E enhancers but that this difference
was not significantly stronger than that of the control regions
(Supplementary Fig. 6), in agreement with the previously reported
overall higher genome-wide GC-content in rat35. By contrast,
we noted that the total content of CpG dinucleotides in rat P/E
promoters is significantly increased compared to the control
regions (Fig. 3e, f), indicating that the activity turnover of P/E
loci is mirrored by a change of CpG frequency in this lineage.
In primates, the GC content did not differ significantly
between the orthologous P/E element sequences; whereas, the
frequency of CpG dinucleotides was significantly higher in
macaque P/E promoters compared to the human P/E enhancers
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, the enrichment in both GC and
CpG content measured in macaque was statistically significant
when compared to the control regions (Supplementary Fig. 7).
The observed GC enrichment reflects the slightly lower GC
content of the macaque genome compared to the human one35.
Overall, the higher CpG content in P/E promoters together with
the reported effect of CpG content on transcription33,34 suggest
that specific changes in nucleotide composition contributed to
the regulatory repurposing of P/E elements both in rodents and
in primates.
Distinct U1 motif and PAS patterns at P/E elements. While
promoters and enhancers both have the inherent capacity to
promote transcription, only promoters generate stable transcripts17.
In mammals, this difference between the two types of
elements seems to be mainly directed by specific signals downstream
of the TSS. U1 sites are commonly enriched downstream
of promoters and depleted in the antisense orientation as well as
around enhancers, whereas PAS generally follow the opposite
trend4,24. Owing to their potential role in transcription, we
compared the distribution of U1 signals and PAS around
orthologous novel P/E elements (Fig. 1b, lower panel). For each
element, we extracted U1 and PAS motifs up- and downstream of
the TSS of their associated transcript in macaque and rat, as well
as for the corresponding orthologous regions in the respective
sister species (Fig. 4a). In both macaque and rat, as expected given
the promoter activity of the P/E elements, the density of U1 sites
downstream of the TSS is higher compared to the antisense
orientation, whereas there is a weak but significant opposite trend
for PAS motifs (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 8). In human and
mouse, consistent with the lack of stable transcripts associated to
P/E elements, there are weak to no differences in U1 or PAS
distribution around each P/E element (Fig. 4c, Supplementary
Fig. 8). We further compared the U1/PAS density in human and
mouse at P/E enhancers to that measured around the TSS of
CAGE-defined non-P/E enhancers elements, similarly characterized
by the lack of stable transcription. Contrary to what is
observed for these non-P/E enhancers, PAS density is significantly
lower on either side of P/E enhancers, and U1 density is
higher downstream but not upstream of the projected TSS
(Supplementary Fig. 8). In light of the higher enhancer-topromoter
repurposing rate (see above), these results suggest that
the unique sequence and motif composition distinguishing P/E
enhancers from other typical enhancers may predispose them to
repurposing into novel promoters during evolution.
Evolutionary changes in the U1/PAS axis. Evolutionary changes
in the U1/PAS axis have been proposed as a mechanism underlying
the emergence of new transcribed loci that may be selectively
preserved and thus form new genes25. However, so far,
evidence supporting this hypothesis has been limited. We therefore
took advantage of our dataset of orthologous P/E element
pairs to test whether evolutionary changes in the U1 and PAS
motif distributions around these loci might underlie their regulatory
activity transformation. A comparison of the distribution
of U1 sites surrounding orthologous P/E elements in rodents
reveals that their density is significantly higher over 1 kilobase
(kb) downstream of the TSS of rat P/E promoters than in the
orthologous non-transcribed regions of mouse P/E enhancers
(mean of 2.83 vs. 2.25 U1 sites per kb, Wilcoxon’s test,

is no significant difference in the corresponding upstream
regions. Analyses of PAS distributions for the same regions only
reveal a weak decrease in PAS density downstream of the TSS of
rat P/E promoters (mean of 1.45 vs. 1.70 PAS sites per kb, Wilcoxon’s
test, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P < 10−2, Supplementary
Fig. 9) and no difference in the antisense orientation. In
primates, we find a significant trend in U1 motif distribution
around orthologous P/E elements similar to that detected in
rodents (Fig. 4e) but no difference in PAS density (Supplementary
Fig. 9), probably due to the low sequence divergence between
human and macaque and the resulting lack of power36. Furthermore,
the distance separating the TSS from the closest
downstream U1 site in P/E promoters is significantly shorter than
that for orthologous P/E enhancers (one-tailed Wilcoxon’s test,
Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P < 10−2; Fig. 4f, Supplementary
Fig. 10). Finally, U1 sites preceded a PAS downstream of rat P/E
promoter TSSs in rat in 84.8% of the cases, compared to 66.8%
for the orthologous mouse P/E enhancers (Fisher’s exact test, P <
10−3), with no significant differences in primates. Altogether, our
analyses reveal evolutionary shifts in the distribution of U1 sites
and, to a lesser extent, PAS motifs, which mirror the presence or
absence of stable transcripts (i.e., promoter or enhancer activity)
at P/E loci. Thus, changes in the U1/PAS axis may contribute to
the origination of promoters from enhancers and, as a consequence,
the emergence of new transcribed loci and, ultimately,
functional new genes in mammals.
Discussion
Mammalian promoters and enhancers share many similarities in
their chromatin architecture, and—apart from a minor fraction of
bivalent elements20—these regulatory loci are best distinguished
based on the stability of their associated transcripts17. This suggests
that small changes in the DNA sequences underlying or
surrounding regulatory regions could redefine their activity. In
our work, we provide support for this hypothesis by identifying
hundreds of mammalian elements that experienced an evolutionary
turnover in their regulatory activity, and by tracing specific
sequence changes that accompanied this process.
Previous attempts to identify evolutionarily repurposed regulatory
sequences uncovered 11 mouse lncRNA promoters that
were orthologous to putative enhancer elements in human30,31.
The low number of identified candidate elements is likely due to
the long evolutionary distance separating the two species. Notably,
the divergent activity in these cases might not necessarily
result from a repurposing event, but could rather be the result of
independent evolution. To overcome these issues, we focused on
the comparison of more closely related species in our study, and
we used inactive genomic regions as controls to assess whether
the divergent activity of P/E elements likely results from evolutionary
switches in their function. The hundreds of P/E elements
uncovered here indicate that the evolutionary turnover of regulatory
element activity is much more extensive than could have
been estimated based on the human/mouse comparisons, but

even so, we have likely underestimated the number of functionally
repurposed elements. For example, we conservatively excluded
a large number of putative bivalent regulatory elements
(characterized by enhancer and promoter activity in the same
species) in order to maximize the confidence in detecting true
turnover events, which may have led to the removal of many real
enhancers characterized by H3K4me3 enrichment17. Through the
integration of chromatin profiles and transcriptome data from
additional organs and from multiple species, future analyses will
allow to more precisely estimate the occurrence of regulatory
repurposing in mammals. In any event, our work indicates that
the repurposing of regulatory elements activity is a widespread
process shaping the mammalian regulatory landscape.
We note that our ability to detect cases of a functional
enhancer repurposed into a functional promoter (and vice versa)
is highly dependent on the definition of functional regulatory
regions. In this regard, it is important to remember that enhancers
defined through their enrichment for specific histone modifications
tend to have relatively low in vitro validation rates
(~50%)37, although recent work showed that the number of
validated elements may be underestimated by episomal-based
essays38. It is possible, therefore, that the changes in transcriptional
stability produced by some repurposing events might not
involve functional enhancers in human and mouse. However, the
putative enhancer activity of around 32% and 17% of all P/E
elements in human and mouse, respectively, was predicted based
on their unstable bidirectional transcription, which has a higher
validation rate compared to other essays4 (67.4–73.9%). Notably,
when considering only CAGE-defined enhancers in our dataset,
we still observe a significantly higher fraction of repurposing
events compared to those detected in our control set of inactive
regions (0.18%/0.28% vs. 0.04%/0.02% in primates/rodents,
Fisher’s exact test P < 10−14), supporting the hypothesis that
repurposing events do involve bona fide enhancers that evolve
into promoters able to drive stable transcription in mammals.
Our investigation of P/E element activity in outgroup species
suggests that most turnover events seem to involve the repurposing
of ancestral enhancer elements into species-specific promoters,
and that this observation cannot be solely explained by
the higher evolutionary turnover of enhancers compared to
promoters in mammals26. It should be noted that more than half
of the alignable P/E elements in each lineage had no detectable
activity in the outgroup species. This is likely due to the relatively
large evolutionary distance that separates our core set of species
from their evolutionary outgroups. Consequently, the regulatory
activity of these loci might either have emerged after the split of
the outgroup lineages or might have been lost during the evolution
of the outgroup species lineages. Although we cannot exclude
that the inferred directionality of the repurposing process is
influenced by the lack of definition of the ancestral state for part
of the P/E loci, such a scenario is unlikely to fully explain the
biased enhancer-to-promoter conversion pattern. On the contrary,
the higher rate of enhancer turnover should in principle
disfavor the detection of enhancer-to-promoter turnover events,
given that it reduces the likelihood of detecting enhancers conserved
in more distantly related species. Our results therefore
suggest the existence of differences in repurposing potential
between enhancers and promoters, which could involve their
underlying DNA sequence and/or aspects of their chromatin
composition. Future work, involving more closely related species,
or different populations of the same species, will be necessary to
further explore the biased directionality of the repurposing process
and uncover its mechanistic bases.
The sequence analysis of P/E elements revealed features that
distinguish these loci from other regulatory loci, and it provided
initial evidence for the potential mechanisms behind the
repurposing process. Notably, the high GC and CpG content
could make P/E loci particularly prone to drive the expression of
neighboring sequences, for example through the recruitment of
CpG-binding proteins, such as Cfp139. This protein is known
to deposit H3K4me3 marks over the bound sequence40, which
in turn seems to favor transcription through different
mechanisms41,42. Moreover, recent work showed how CpG sites
favor promoter over enhancer activity in a massively parallel
regulatory element assay in mouse43. The significantly higher
CpG content of P/E elements with promoter activity strongly
suggests that the fixation of nucleotide substitutions contributed
to the turnover events by increasing (or decreasing) the density of
this dinucleotide, leading to the creation or disruption of specific
motifs that altered transcriptional capacities.
Moreover, U1 site density shifts also seem to be involved in the
repurposing process. A higher number and a higher proximity of
U1 sites characterize the region downstream of the TSS of P/Eassociated
transcripts, compared to their transcriptionally inactive
orthologous regions. U1 sites are thought to promote transcript
stability in mammals, suggesting that changes in the distribution
of these motifs might be responsible for the stabilization or
destabilization of P/E-associated RNAs. On the other hand, it is
unclear whether the redistribution of polyadenylation signals
(PASs) has had a significant influence on the turnover processes.
Although PASs are slightly depleted downstream of the TSS
compared to the upstream region, we found little to no differences
in PAS distribution between orthologous P/E elements.
Therefore, at least in this context, variation in U1 site distribution
could be sufficient to drive the repurposing process.
The finding of numerous P/E elements raises the question of
what impact repurposing events have on mammalian phenotypic
evolution. We believe the influence of this process regarding the
(ancestral) enhancer function of P/E elements is likely limited.
The enhancer activity exerted by many mammalian promoters
suggests that the emergence of stable transcripts associated to P/E
elements might not abolish their distal regulatory activity20.
Additionally, the potential loss of enhancer activity of a P/E
element upon its regulatory repurposing might not affect the
expression of its target gene(s), as it could be compensated for by
the presence of other enhancers44,45. On the other hand, repurposing
events might be phenotypically relevant through their
contribution to the process of the birth and death of genes and
transcripts. Our results provide solid evidence for the emergence
of lineage-specific, stable transcripts from former enhancer elements.
These transcripts may, potentially, represent new genes,
which would support the hypothesis put forward by Wu and
Sharp25. Overall, our analysis highlights regulatory repurposing
as a mechanism underlying molecular innovation in mammals
and calls for future work to unveil the impact of the repurposing
process on mammalian phenotypic evolution.
Methods
RNA-seq data production and processing. We generated 78 single-end strandspecific
RNA-seq libraries from brain, heart, kidney, and liver samples for six
mammals (human, macaque, marmoset, mouse, rat, and rabbit; Supplementary
Table 2). Human samples derive from both adult and postnatal developmental
stages, while all other mammalian samples stem from adult individuals (Supplementary
Table 2). RNA was extracted from each sample using the RNeasy protocol
from QIAGEN. RNeasy Micro columns were used to extract RNA from small
(<5 mg) or fibrous samples and RNeasy Mini columns were used to extract RNA
from larger samples. The tissues were homogenized in RLT buffer supplemented
with 40 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) or QIAzol. RNA quality was assessed using the
Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). The RNA-seq libraries were created
using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were
sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 to produce 100 nucleotide (nt) reads. The
resulting transcriptome data were combined with a set of recently published
transcriptome data32. Our study complies with all relevant ethical regulations with
respect to both human samples and samples for the other mammals. Human
samples were obtained from official scientific tissue banks or dedicated companies;

informed consent was obtained by these sources from donors prior to death or
from next-of-kin. The use of all human samples for the type of work described in
this study was approved by an Ethics Screening panel from the European Research
Council (ERC) (associated with H.K.‘s ERC Consolidator Grant 615253, OntoTransEvol)
and local ethics committees; that is, from the Cantonal Ethics Commission
Lausanne (authorization 504/12) and Ethics Commission from the
Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University (authorization S-220/2017). The use of all
other mammalian samples was approved by an ERC Ethics Screening panel (ERC
Consolidator Grant 615253, OntoTransEvol).
RNA-seq reads were aligned to the assembled genomes of their corresponding
species (all genomes obtained from the UCSC website; human: hg38; macaque:
rheMac8; marmoset: calJac3; mouse: mm10; rat: rn6; rabbit: oryCun2) using
STAR46 (version 2.2.1) using the 2-pass mapping mode and standard settings.
Aligned reads from all replicates of each organ, totaling on average >100 million
mapped reads, were used to reconstruct transcripts through a genome-guided de
novo transcriptome assembly using StringTie47 (version 1.3.4d) with the following
parameters: -j 5 –g 50. Assembled transcripts from each organ were then merged
using Cuffmerge48 to define a unique set of transcripts. Expression levels
(measured in FPKM) of the assembled transcripts were calculated with Cuffnorm48
(version 2.2.1); we considered as stable all transcripts with a mean FPKM > 1 across
replicates from the same organ and length (introns included) >1000 nt.
ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data processing. The chromatin data used in our
studies derive from different sources. DNase, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac
data for mouse brain, heart, kidney, and liver (core dataset) were obtained from the
Mouse ENCODE database49 (Supplementary Data 8). DNase, H3K4me3,
H3K4me1, and H3K27ac data from human brain, heart, kidney, and liver were
obtained from the ENCODE database50 or from the human Epigenome Roadmap
database51 (Supplementary Data 8). For both species, we also downloaded
H3K4me3 data from additional adult and developmental samples from the same
databases (extended dataset) (Supplementary Data 8). All processed data corresponding
to an older genome assembly version were converted to the newest
assembly version using LiftOver52. As data were processed in different ways, we
applied a common approach to have comparable datasets. Specifically, we downloaded
processed peaks (in narrowPeak format) from multiple replicates of all
samples, and subsampled the top 20′000 (for H3K4me3 data) or top 80′000 peaks
(for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), ranked based on their peak score; all DNase
hypersensitive site (DHS) peaks from each sample were retained as their numbers
did not differ significantly across samples. We created organ/tissue-specific sets of
H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac peaks by considering loci shared by at least
three replicates from each organ (or by both replicates if only two samples were
available), except when peaks were already derived from merged samples, as for the
adult mouse organs. We finally resized the peaks to 1000 nt centered on the
summit of the peak (or on the middle of the peak when the summit was not
available).
Definition of regulatory and inactive regions. In each species, we defined as
promoters the 1000 nt located upstream of a stable transcript. Putative enhancers
in human and mouse were initially defined as DHSs overlapping an H3K27ac and/
or an H3K4me1 peak. The resulting set of enhancers was further filtered to exclude
loci located closer than 1000 nt from any H3K4me3 peak from any organs/tissues
(including the extended dataset) or that overlap the 1000 nt region upstream of the
TSS or the exons of any (stable or unstable) transcript. We further downloaded
enhancer sets defined using CAGE from human and mouse4 (permissive enhancers
phase 1 and 2). These loci were subjected to the same filtering process described
above, and then included in the final list of putative enhancers.
To define the set of inactive regions, we sampled from the human and mouse
genome up to 1.5 million non-overlapping 1000 nt loci, and then removed from
this list all loci mapping closer than 1000 nt from: (a) any DHS or any H3K4me1,
H3K4me3 or H3K27ac peak from all organs from the core and extended dataset.
Regions marked by active chromatin modifications but not DNase hypersensitive
were excluded as they could potentially represent elements active in untested
tissues or developmental stages; (b) any exon from all assembled (stable or
unstable) or annotated transcripts53,54 (GENCODE versions 27 for human and
version vM16 for mouse); (c) any high identity (95%) segmental duplication or
high identity (95%) repeat element annotated in the UCSC database55.
Definition and comparisons of P/E elements. Coordinates of all regulatory and
inactive regions from human and mouse were converted on the macaque and rat
genome, respectively, using LiftOver52 (with -minMatch = 0.6) to define their
orthologous loci. A two-way liftOver conversion (species A—>species B—>species
A) was adopted to avoid ambiguous orthology definitions that may result from
genomic duplication events. We defined as P/E elements all human and mouse
enhancers whose orthologous loci in macaque and rat, respectively, overlapped the
500 nt upstream of the TSS of a stable transcript. To avoid the inclusion of false
positives due to potential 5′-truncated isoforms, we excluded from our final P/E
elements dataset those associated to shorter isoforms of transcribed loci with an
alternative, upstream promoter in macaque or rat. As a control, we identified all
inactive regions in human and mouse whose orthologous sites in their sister species
overlapped the 500 nt upstream of the TSS of a stable transcript, and then compared
the frequency of these loci with the frequency of P/E elements in each core
sample with a Fisher’s exact test. P/E elements were analysed separately to assess
whether the associated transcript in macaque or rat corresponded to a new isoform
of a transcribed locus present in the sister species (extended P/E element) or to a
newly transcribed locus (novel P/E element). Shared transcribed loci between
orthologous species were defined by the overlap of the orthologous sequences
of macaque/rat transcripts (determined using liftOver) with reconstructed or
GENCODE annotated transcripts in human/mouse.
We observed a significant difference in GC-content between the sets of
enhancers and inactive regions (with an ortholog in the sister species). To control
for the GC-content effect, we resampled sets of enhancers and inactive regions with
a similar GC distribution. To this aim, we considered only enhancers with a
GC-content lower than 46% (for human) or 41% (for mouse). These thresholds,
roughly corresponding to the mode of the GC distribution of the enhancers set in
the two species, were chosen as they represented the maximum value below which
the GC distribution of inactive regions overlapped completely the GC distribution
of the enhancers. Then, we subsampled up to 30,000 enhancers from each species
(in order to have similar numbers of regions tested in both lineages), and for each
locus we selected an inactive region with the most similar GC content. With this
approach, we obtained sets of enhancers and inactive regions with statistically
similar GC distributions and used these data to compare the frequency of P/E
enhancers to that of inactive regions orthologous to promoters.
ChIP-seq analysis of P/E elements. To further support the promoter functionality
of P/E promoters in rat and macaque, we compared their H3K4me3 profiles to
those of other regulatory elements using liver ChIP-seq data obtained from Villar
et al.26 and aligned on the respective genomes using bwa aln56. In both species, the
enhancer set corresponded to the orthologous putative enhancers projected (using
liftOver) from their sister species. The promoters corresponded to putative conserved
promoters, i.e. to macaque/rat promoters orthologous to human/mouse
promoters, respectively (based on liftOver conversion). Only enhancers and promoter
active in liver were used. Finally, we compared the average H3K4me3
coverage, normalized using the average input coverage, between all classes of
regulatory elements with a Mann–Whitney U-test.
PhastCons analysis. We extracted the phastCons scores from P/E enhancers and
other enhancers in human and mouse and plotted them over the whole regulatory
region (pseudoscaled to 1000 nt) and over the neighboring 1000 nt regions using
SeqPlots57. Heatmap clusters were defined using k-mean clustering. The phastCons
data used corresponded to the “hg38.phastCons20way” for human (multiple
alignments of 17 primates and three mammals) and the “mm10.60way.phastCons60wayGlire”
for mouse (multiple alignment of 8 glires).
Polarization of turnover events. To define the directionality of the turnover
events, we evaluated the presence of putative promoters or enhancers in regions
syntenic to P/E elements active in liver in marmoset and rabbit. In marmoset and
rabbit, enhancers corresponded to H3K27ac peaks not overlapping any H3K4me3
peak, the 1000 nt upstream of any (stable or unstable) assembled transcript, or any
exon of these transcripts; promoters were defined as the 1000 nt upstream of the
TSS of a stable transcript. Macaque and rat liver P/E element coordinates were
converted in their outgroup species genome using LiftOver (with -minMatch =
0.4), and we then evaluated the overlap between the converted coordinates and the
annotated regulatory regions.
To estimate the rate of regulatory element loss, we identified the orthologous
loci of liver promoters and enhancers from human and mouse in the other species
from the same clade (macaque/marmoset and rat/rabbit, respectively), and kept
only those loci that aligned to all species of the same clade. We then identified
human/mouse promoters associated (i.e. overlapping the 500 nt upstream of the
TSS) to a stable liver transcript in marmoset/rabbit (ancestral promoters).
Similarly, we defined as ancestral enhancers the human/mouse enhancers which
overlapped an H3K27ac peak and that were not associated to a promoter or an
H3K4me3 peak in marmoset/rabbit. The same approach was used to define
human/mouse promoters and enhancers conserved in macaque/rat. Ancestral
promoters and enhancers, which were not conserved in macaque/rat were defined
as lost.
To estimate the fraction of ancestral promoters corresponding to P/E elements,
we further calculated the overlap of primate and rodent P/E elements coordinates
converted in marmoset and rabbit, respectively, with the putative promoter of any
stable transcript (from any organ).
Sequence composition of regulatory elements. We extracted and compared the
GC content (using the nuc tool from BEDTools57) and CpG dinucleotides frequency
of different classes of regulatory elements in human and mouse using a
Mann–Whitney U-test. The same features were compared between orthologous P/
E elements in both lineages with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Finally, we estimated
whether the magnitude of the evolutionary change in GC content or CpG frequency
at P/E regions was higher than that measured at inactive regions (defined
above) to control for global skews in sequence composition. This was done by

resampling 10,000 times from the set of inactive regions the same number of P/E
elements, and then comparing the mean GC and CpG difference in P/E elements
with the distribution of differences from the resampled set.
Core promoter motifs on regulatory elements. Core promoter motifs (POLII
collection) were obtained from the JASPAR 2018 database58. We compared the
relative enrichment of core promoter motifs between P/E elements and other
promoters and enhancers using AME58 with parameters --method ranksum and
--scoring max to evaluate differences in the maximum strength of the motifs.
U1/PAS motif composition of regulatory elements. We defined the U1
nucleotide motif with the de novo tool from HOMER59 (version 4.8.3) using as
input the FASTA sequences of the 50 bp around each splicing donor site (−25/
+25 nt) from 50,000 randomly selected human GENCODE transcripts. A similar
approach was adopted to define the PAS motif using a set of experimentally defined
PASs from human60. We determined the genome-wide location of U1 and PAS
sites with the scanMotifGenomeWide tool from HOMER59. To compare the distribution
of the U1 and PAS motifs around P/E elements, we considered the most
upstream TSS of all P/E-associated transcripts in macaque and rat and projected
their location in the corresponding sister species using BLAT61. We considered
only novel P/E elements, given that U1/PAS motifs from downstream transcripts in
extended P/E loci might have conflated the U1/PAS signal in mouse and human.
We compared the density of U1 and PAS motifs over 1 kb up- and downstream of
the P/E-associated TSS in each species using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The
same approach was used to compare the density of these motifs between sister
species. The proximity of the closest U1 or PAS site up- or downstream of the P/Eassociated
TSSs was calculated using closestBed from BEDTools57. To compare the
distribution of U1/PAS sites at enhancer elements, we considered only CAGEdefined
enhancers in human and mouse, and used their annotated CAGE peak as
the TSS of each element. We used liftOver to define the orthologous loci of human
and mouse enhancers in macaque and rat, respectively. We then averaged the
number of U1 and PAS motifs located 1000 bp up- and downstream of each
enhancer TSS and compared their density to that of P/E elements in all species.

Species-specific, new, or “orphan” genes account for 10%–30% of eukaryotic genomes. Although initially considered to have limited function, an increasing number of orphan genes have been shown to provide important phenotypic innovation. How new genes acquire regulatory sequences for proper temporal and spatial expression is unknown. Orphan gene regulation may rely in part on origination in open chromatin adjacent to preexisting promoters, although this has not yet been assessed by genome-wide analysis of chromatin states. Here, we combine taxon-rich nematode phylogenies with Iso-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to identify the gene structure and epigenetic signature of orphan genes in the satellite model nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Consistent with previous findings, we find young genes are shorter, contain fewer exons, and are on average less strongly expressed than older genes. However, the subset of orphan genes that are expressed exhibit distinct chromatin states from similarly expressed conserved genes. Orphan gene transcription is determined by a lack of repressive histone modifications, confirming long-held hypotheses that open chromatin is important for new gene formation. Yet orphan gene start sites more closely resemble enhancers defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks, in contrast to conserved genes that exhibit traditional promoters defined by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Although the majority of orphan genes are located on chromosome arms that contain high recombination rates and repressive histone marks, strongly expressed orphan genes are more randomly distributed. Our results support a model of new gene origination by rare integration into open chromatin near enhancers.

Gene regulation is a highly orchestrated process that includes transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, and chromatin structure (Voss and Hager 2014). The identification and mechanism of these molecular factors have been revealed for several conserved gene networks leading toward a better understanding of development and disease. But how new genes, also referred to as orphan or taxon-restricted, acquire this complex architecture is unknown. For the increasing number of identified new genes that provide important biological function (Burki and Kaessmann 2004; Cai et al. 2008; Rosso et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2010, 2013b; Reinhardt et al. 2013; Mayer et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2017), the evolutionary path from origin to integration into gene networks depends on their precise transcriptional regulation (Carelli et al. 2016). Yet in the majority of cases, it is unclear how even the most fundamental cis-regulatory elements like promoter and termination sequences are obtained (Tautz and Domazet-Lošo 2011; Long et al. 2013). Orphan genes can originate de novo or by duplication, recombination, or horizontal gene transfer into preexisting regulatory architecture (Betrán and Long 2003; Kaessmann et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Kaessmann 2010; Chen et al. 2012b; McLysaght and Hurst 2016), but the extent to which this occurs is limited by the potential to disrupt the genes already there (Vinckenbosch et al. 2006). In the few cases in which integration has been observed, the presence of nearby regulatory sequences was largely detected by proximity, or sequence homology with known promoters, CpG islands, or TFBSs (Carvunis et al. 2012; Abrusán 2013; Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). Given these constraints, the contribution of preexisting regulatory architecture to new gene transcription is still unknown and, with functional genomic information (e.g., chromatin states and enhancers), could potentially be large. Indeed, a recent analysis of mammalian ChIP-seq data sets found 51% of expressed mouse retrogenes (mRNAs that are reverse transcribed and inserted into the genome) exhibit robust H3K4 trimethylation (Carelli et al. 2016), and transcription of the new gene QQS in Arabidopsis thaliana is inversely correlated with DNA methylation at 5′ transposable elements (Silveira et al. 2013), suggesting an important role for chromatin regulation in new gene transcription. We sought to use the rich taxonomic resources of nematodes to first identify young and old genes, and then observe their regulatory architecture by several genome-wide approaches.

The diplogastrid nematode Pristionchus pacificus can be found in a necromenic relationship with beetles, but has been developed in the laboratory as a satellite model for comparative studies to C. elegans (Fig. 1A–D; Sommer and Streit 2011; Sommer and McGaughran 2013). More recent genetic analysis of dimorphic mouth-forms (Fig. 1E–G) has led to P. pacificus emerging as an important model system for phenotypic plasticity in its own right (Bento et al. 2010; Ragsdale et al. 2013; Kieninger et al. 2016; Serobyan et al. 2016). In addition to the vast taxonomic diversity and corresponding genomes of other nematode species, the recent high-quality chromosome-scale genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) and reverse genetic tools (Witte et al. 2015) in P. pacificus provide a robust framework for studying new genes (Baskaran et al. 2015; Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Here, we probe the gene structure, expression, and regulatory architecture of P. pacificus evolutionary gene classes with long-read Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) transcript sequencing (Iso-Seq), traditional high-depth RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of six histone post-translational modifications and assay for transposon-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). In addition to our findings, the data sets collected provide the first epigenomic map in P. pacificus, which is only the second comprehensive chromatin state annotation in nematodes, creating a resource for future functional and comparative studies.

Comparison of Pristionchus pacificus and Caenorhabditis elegans and phylogenetic relationship. (A,B). P. pacificus is often found in a necromenic relationship with insect hosts, preferentially scarab beetles, in the dormant dauer state. When the beetle dies, worms exit the dauer stage to feed on bacteria that bloom on the decomposing carcass. (C,D) C. elegans, the classic nematode model organism, is often found in leaf detritus and rotting fruits. Example rotting apple photo taken by M.S.W. (E–G) P. pacificus has become an important model for developmental (phenotypic) plasticity. Adults can adopt (E) a narrow mouth form with one tooth (stenostomatous [St]) that makes them strict bacterial feeders. However, the “boom-and-bust” life cycle creates significant competition for resources, and under crowded conditions adults can develop an alternative mouth form (F) with a wider buccal cavity and an extra tooth (eurystomatous [Eu]) that allows them to prey on other nematodes. (G) Shown here is a eurystomatous P. pacificus preying on a C. elegans larva. (H) A schematic phylogeny of nematodes that was generated based on the publications of Holterman et al. (2017) and Van Megen et al. (2009). (I) Breakdown of P. pacificus genes by evolutionary category: One-to-one orthology with C. elegans (C. elegans 1:1) is the most conserved, followed by genes sharing homology with at least one gene from the 24 other nematodes (homologous), and finally genes that are only found in Pristionchus (orphan). All categories were defined by BLASTP homology (e-value ≤0.001) (Methods).

Partitioning of P. pacificus genes into evolutionary classes
The first P. pacificus draft genome published in 2008 (Dieterich et al. 2008) had a large number of genes with undetectable homology. Although the confidence in these gene predictions was initially low, every subsequent refinement of both the genome and gene annotation continually detected 20%–40% of genes that appear as new, orphan, or taxon-restricted (Sinha et al. 2012; Baskaran et al. 2015; Baskaran and Rödelsperger 2015; Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Using our most recent chromosome-scale PacBio genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) and 24 other nematode species, we reevaluated the relative abundance of evolutionary gene classes (Fig. 1H). We defined the most highly conserved genes as having 1:1 orthology with C. elegans (BLASTP e-value ≤ 0.001), which is estimated to have diverged from P. pacificus between 60 to 90 million years ago (Cutter 2008; Rota-Stabelli et al. 2013; Hedges et al. 2015). We also defined an intermediate conserved class as “homologs” if they display homology with at least one gene in the other 24 nematode species (Methods)—which could represent either relatively young genes or old genes that have been lost. Finally, we define “orphan” genes as having no homology with genes in the other 24 queried species. The resulting partition of genes approximates the “30% rule” of new gene composition (Fig. 1I; Khalturin et al. 2009). We then applied several genomic approaches to molecularly characterize each evolutionary gene class.

Characterization of gene structure by long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-Seq)
We sought to improve the overall gene annotation in P. pacificus and then characterize the genetic structure of each evolutionary gene class using PacBio Iso-Seq on mixed-developmental stage RNA (Supplemental Methods; Supplemental Fig. S1A–C). After alignment, we obtained 640,664 reads with a median insert size of 1363 nucleotides (Supplemental Fig. S1D). Despite low read depth compared to conventional RNA-seq, our Iso-Seq data covered 17,307 genes (68% of genes in the reference annotation “El Paco”) (Rödelsperger et al. 2017).

Relative to the current reference annotation, Iso-Seq identified a tighter distribution of gene lengths (median Iso-Seq = 1452 compared to median reference = 1599, P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2A). This difference appears to be due to a more narrow distribution of exons, with 96.5% of Iso-Seq gene annotations containing between 1 and 20 exons, compared to 85.7% for the reference annotation (P = <2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2B). The tighter distribution is also more consistent with the highly curated gene annotation of C. elegans in which 98.0% of genes contain between 1 and 20 exons (Supplemental Fig. S1E,F; Deutsch and Long 1999). This potential improvement in accuracy appears to result from fragmentation of excessively long gene predictions into distinct transcripts (for example, see Supplemental Fig. S1G).

Long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-Seq) improves gene annotation, identifies alternative splicing, and can distinguish different evolutionary gene classes by gene structure. (A) Density distribution of cDNA gene lengths between the El Paco reference (gray) and Iso-Seq annotation (black). The Iso-Seq annotation was derived from guided assembly using StringTie (Pertea et al. 2016; Methods), and plots were created using the density function in R. (B) Density distribution of exons per gene between El Paco reference and Iso-Seq annotations. Method and color scheme are similar to A. (C) Alternatively spliced isoforms, defined as having multiple detected isoforms with the same start and stop coordinates. The white column represents genes containing isoforms that have the same exon–intron structure but different splice sites, and red columns represent genes containing isoforms with different numbers of exons due to intron retention or exon inclusion/exclusion. (D) Example locus of Iso-Seq reads compared to standard short-read RNA-seq. Also shown are Iso-Seq-assembled isoforms compared to the single reference gene umm-S259-11.10-mRNA-1, visualized using Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV). (E,F) Percent coverage of evolutionary gene classes by Iso-Seq with either the “direct” method (E) or rRNA-depleted “total RNA” (F). (G–I) Iso-Seq coverage per gene of each evolutionary class in direct (y-axis) compared to total (x-axis). Coverage was determined by BEDTools, and median ratios of direct/total RNA are presented. Lines (slope = 1, y intercept = 0) represent equal coverage between methods. (J,K) Similar density distributions of cDNA length and exon number as in A and B, but for the three evolutionary gene classes.

Long-read Iso-Seq also provides more robust identification of isoforms, which are historically difficult to assemble from standard short-read RNA sequencing (Conesa et al. 2016). Approximately half (50.6%) of expressed genes in P. pacificus exhibit greater than one isoform, and roughly a third (30.9%) exhibit greater than three isoforms (Supplemental Fig. S1H,I). However, some of these transcripts could be artifacts biased by incomplete coverage of 5′ ends.

Hence, we conservatively defined alternatively spliced isoforms as transcripts with the same start and stop coordinates, but differential exon inclusion or exclusion, intron retention, or differential splice site. Under this classification we observed 3861 (24%) of expressed genes exhibit alternative splicing in P. pacificus (Fig. 2C), similar to the ∼25% of genes estimated in C. elegans (Ramani et al. 2011). As an example, we highlight gene umm-s259-11.10-mRNA, where the majority of Iso-Seq reads (17/19) cover the entire transcript yielding eight isoforms, in stark contrast to standard short-read sequencing, which rarely covers more than three exons per read (Fig. 2D). Collectively, a tighter distribution of transcript lengths and exon numbers, and diversity of isoforms, suggests that Iso-Seq improves the quality and quantity of gene annotation in P. pacificus.

Among evolutionary gene classes, most C. elegans 1:1 orthologs (88%), and approximately half of homologous and orphan genes (46% and 56%, respectively) exhibit Iso-Seq coverage, demonstrating that our Iso-Seq data are sensitive enough to detect thousands of transcripts from each evolutionary gene class (Fig. 2E). We also performed Iso-Seq on rRNA-depleted “total RNA” (Supplemental Methods) to assess whether young genes are un-, or under-polyadenylated, which is typical of noncoding RNAs (Derrien et al. 2012). We found a similar percent coverage from the direct and total RNA methods (Fig. 2E,F) and a consistent polyadenylation read bias for all gene classes (Fig. 2G–I). Hence most young genes, or at least transcribed young genes, are polyadenylated. Because polyadenylation is an important component of transcriptional and translational regulation (Proudfoot et al. 2002; Proudfoot 2011), this argues that most young genes have retained, or already acquired, 3′ termination and processing sequence architecture.

We then used our Iso-Seq annotation to characterize gene length and exon number between evolutionary gene classes. Consistent with other systems (Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Stein et al. 2018), we found a strong bias of C. elegans 1:1 orthologs to be longer and contain more exons than homologs, which in turn were longer and contained more exons than orphan genes (P = <2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2J,K). The intermediate gene structure of intermediate conserved genes (homologs) is also consistent with a transitional evolutionary path between young and old genes proposed by Carvunis et al. (2012) (Abrusán 2013; Neme and Tautz 2013). In the following sections we seek to characterize and compare the chromatin regulation of young versus old genes.

The P. pacificus epigenome
To identify regulatory regions and expression levels of orphan, homolog, and C. elegans 1:1 orthologs, we performed two to three replicates of ChIP-seq on nine histone modifications and two replicates of RNA-seq in P. pacificus adults, and two replicates of ATAC-seq on mixed-stage cultures (Supplemental Fig. S2; Supplemental Table S3; Supplemental Methods). All data sets showed good correlations between biological replicates (Pearson’s correlation between 0.70–0.93 for ChIP-seq, 0.88 for ATAC-seq, and 0.98 for gene FPKMs in RNA-seq) (Supplemental Fig. S3). We identified enriched regions (i.e., peaks) for each replicate of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq using MACS2 (Methods; Supplemental Table S1; Zhang et al. 2008). H2Bub, H3K9ac, and H3K79me2 exhibited <50% peak reproducibility and were excluded from further analysis (Supplemental Fig. S4A). The majority of remaining samples exhibited >70% overlap between replicates, except for H3K9me3 (54% reproducibility). However, H3K9me3 is a broadly distributed histone modification that is challenging for peak-finding software (Wang et al. 2013), and although most H3K9me3 antibodies are of low specificity (Nishikori et al. 2012; Hattori et al. 2013), they can nevertheless distinguish constitutive versus facultative heterochromatin (Trojer and Reinberg 2007).

We also performed ATAC-seq for identifying regions of open chromatin (Buenrostro et al. 2013). Although the standard protocol led to reproducible peaks, initially we could not identify nucleosomal read density, perhaps suggesting a difficulty of obtaining higher resolution fragments from highly differentiated and heterogeneous cell populations. Yet the new Omni-ATAC method (Corces et al. 2017) yielded nucleosomal and subnucleosomal read densities (Supplemental Fig. S2E), which we used for subsequent analysis.

We clustered the six high-confidence histone marks and Omni-ATAC-seq data using a hidden Markov model (ChromHMM) (Ernst and Kellis 2012) into eight chromatin states (Fig. 3A). Each chromatin state is enriched in histone modifications that define specific functional domains, such as actively transcribed regions, heterochromatin, and regulatory loci. We assigned putative chromatin state annotations based on established classifications (Supplemental Table S2; Fig. 3B; Ernst et al. 2011; Rada-Iglesias et al. 2011). We find that, at least at the whole-animal level, approximately half (57%) of the genome is repressed, approximately a fifth (16%) represents actively transcribed genes, and more than a quarter (27%) is regulatory (including 6785 promoters, 13,648 active enhancers, and 3853 “poised” enhancers) (Fig. 3C).

Input is included as a reference, and chromatin state annotations are included at the bottom matching the colors in C. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq coverage are autoscaled per sample, and RNA-seq forward (F) and reverse (R) read coverage is in log-scale.

Next, we verified that histone marks are enriched at the center of promoters and active enhancer annotations, and we performed a de novo motif search (Fig. 3D–G; Heinz et al. 2010). Both promoters (30.6%) and enhancers (22.2%) were enriched in a recognition sequence for MBP1, a yeast transcriptional activator that controls cell-cycle progression (Koch et al. 1993). There is weak homology (BlastP, e = 2 × 10−4) with MBP1 in P. pacificus (UMM-S233-5.4-mRNA-1), and in the future it will be interesting to see if this gene is also involved in cell-cycle control. There were also notable differences between enhancers and promoters, including binding site matches to human homeobox, Drosophila GAGA, and eukaryotic GATA transcription factors, demonstrating the precision of promoter and enhancer annotations, and hinting at the existence of deeply conserved regulatory elements.

As expected, promoter annotations were strongly enriched at the 5′ end of genes (Fig. 3H). There was also another peak near the 3′ end of genes. Enhancers were also enriched at both 5′ and 3′ ends, although they are more evenly distributed throughout gene bodies. The existence of promoter/enhancer elements at the 3′ ends of genes has been observed in other species, and although their functions are still unclear, there are several reports supporting promoter-3′-end chromatin looping to facilitate successive rounds of transcription and enforce directionality (O'Sullivan et al. 2004; Lainé et al. 2009; Grzechnik et al. 2014; Werner et al. 2017).

To verify that our chromatin states correlate with a dynamically regulated gene, we looked at Ppa-pax-3, which our laboratory has shown to be expressed in early juvenile stages but is repressed during development (Yi and Sommer 2007). Indeed, we found Ppa-pax-3 is in a large H3K27me3-repressed domain in adults (Fig. 3I). However, we also noticed two putative enhancers after the first exon and 3′ end, perhaps suggesting preparation for activation in developing embryos. Collectively, these data represent the first genome-wide annotation of chromatin regulation in P. pacificus and, to our knowledge, represents only the second comprehensive data set in nematodes.

Chromatin regulation corresponds to gene expression
We extended the previous single gene example to genome-wide high-depth RNA-seq and binned the adult transcriptome into four expression categories (Fig. 4A), then assessed the chromatin states of each. As predicted, gene bodies (exons and introns) of the highest expressed categories (groups 1 and 2) exhibited enrichment in chromatin states designated as “transcriptional transition” and “elongation.” Conversely, repressive chromatin states were virtually absent from genes in the top two categories. In contrast, the two lowest expression categories (groups 3 and 4) exhibited proportionally greater enrichment in repressive chromatin states and decreased enrichment in transcriptional transition and elongation states (Fig. 4B). Although there was a minor enrichment in promoter chromatin states at 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs among high versus low expression categories, there was a larger difference in repressive chromatin states, especially at the 5′ ends. There was also an increase in enhancer enrichment at 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs in the low expression categories, perhaps reflecting a “poised” chromatin state that is reactive to environmental influence. Although promoters and enhancers exhibit a relatively small portion of the genome (15.6%), they comprise the majority of intergenic regions (Fig. 4B), hinting at a large and mostly unexplored regulatory circuitry in the compact nematode genome.

(J) Normalized average densities of H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq over a 7-kb window centered at 5′ ends. Densities were measured in HOMER and normalized to the highest and lowest values in each gene class.

Chromatin regulation of evolutionary gene classes
Next, we assessed the chromatin states of evolutionary gene classes. C. elegans 1:1 orthologs resembled the highest expression categories (groups 1 and 2), whereas conserved and orphan genes more closely resembled the lower expression categories (groups 3 and 4) (Fig. 4C–E). These histone patterns reflect the higher expression of C. elegans 1:1 orthologs compared to less conserved gene classes (Fig. 4F). Nevertheless, we noticed a significant number of orphan and homologous expressed gene outliers (Fig. 4F) and wondered whether their chromatin signatures resembled that of expressed C. elegans 1:1 orthologs. Here, we found differences. Specifically, strongly expressed (groups 1 and 2) orphan and homologous genes, which represent only 9.3% and 12.8% of their respective categories, broadly resembled the general chromatin state pattern of their classes except for having reduced repressive histone marks (Fig. 4G–I). Second, chromatin states 3 and 4, representing transcriptional transition and elongation, are more highly represented in C. elegans 1:1 orthologs compared to expressed orphan and conserved genes. Third, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs exhibit little to no signature of active enhancers (chromatin state 1) at their 5′ ends or 5′ UTRs, which are instead dominated by the promoter chromatin state consisting of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. However, expressed homologous and orphan genes exhibited both promoter and enhancer enrichment at their 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs, and orphan genes, in particular, exhibited greater enrichment in enhancer versus promoter chromatin states.

To investigate this difference more closely, we examined the distribution of histone ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq around the 5′ ends of each evolutionary class. Whereas expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog TSSs are dominated by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, expressed orphan and homologous genes exhibit comparatively stronger enrichment of H3K4me1 and ATAC-seq (Fig. 4J). Specifically, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs exhibit an average 5′ H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio of 10.1, compared to 2.4 for homologs and 1.4 for orphan genes. Furthermore, although 54% of expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog 5′ ends are within 1 kb of an annotated promoter, only 27% of expressed homologous genes and 21% of expressed orphan genes are in similar proximity to promoters (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 5A). Conversely, 46% of expressed homologous and orphan gene TSSs are within 1 kb of active and poised enhancers, compared to 33% of expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog TSSs (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test for both comparisons) (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the expression of groups 1 and 2 orphan and homologous genes are actually higher than C. elegans 1:1 orthologs (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Supplemental Fig. S5), demonstrating that their chromatin architecture is independent of the general correlation with expression. There are two key points from these results. First, the transcription of young genes appears to depend on the absence of repressive heterochromatin, demonstrating a widely held but unconfirmed theory for the requirement of open chromatin in new gene expression. Second, the 5′ end of expressed young genes, especially orphan genes, resemble enhancers rather than canonical promoters.

(A) Distance cumulative frequency distribution of the nearest promoter, or (B) enhancer (active and poised) to transcription start sites (TSSs) from each evolutionary gene category. (C) Model of new gene transcriptional regulation. Enhancers exhibit bidirectional transcription, which can lead to de novo gene expression, or expression of duplications/insertions. If the new gene provides a useful function, selection will occur on not only protein function, but also the gene structure leading to more exons, and on regulatory elements to provide more temporal or spatial control, and more or less transcription. Ultimately, evolution on enhancer sequences will convert it to a traditional promoter.

Genomic position affects chromatin regulation of evolutionary gene classes
Finally, we analyzed the general pattern of chromatin marks and evolutionary gene classes at the chromosomal level (Fig. 6). We observed strong patterns of activating marks in the center of autosomes II–V and the repressive mark H3K27me3 on the chromosome arms. Conversely the X Chromosome was highly enriched in both repressive marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. These patterns have been observed in C. elegans (Liu et al. 2011), and they correspond to general patterns in nematodes of dense clusters of conserved genes and low recombination rates in the center of chromosomes, and species-specific genes and high recombination rates in the chromosome arms (Coghlan 2005). However, Chromosome I in P. pacificus is an exception to other autosomes, in which we observed two bands of activating marks instead of one. Recent analysis suggests that roughly half of P. pacificus Chromosome I is homologous with C. elegans Chromosome X, and the other half is homologous with Chromosome V (Rödelsperger et al. 2017). The P. pacificus chromosome pattern was viewed as ancestral because this organization is also found in the distantly related nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. However, the bipartite presence of histone modifications and conserved genes hints at an ancient chromosomal fusion from an even earlier origin, or frequent and repeated chromosomal fission and fusion events.

Figure 6.
Chromosome-wide distribution of histone modifications reveals distinct patterns for evolutionary gene classes and a double-band pattern on Chr I. Genome-wide patterns of histone modifications from ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq presented as a heatmap with increasing abundance from white to blue, and white to red for RNA-seq (normalized by depth). Also plotted are gene densities of each evolutionary class binned by expressed (groups 1 and 2) or transcriptionally repressed (groups 3 and 4) for each class.

The chromosome-scale distribution of evolutionary gene classes was consistent with histone modification patterns. Specifically, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs, which are strongly expressed, are enriched in the active histone mark chromosome centers. Conversely, the lower expressed homologous and orphan genes are enriched in the chromosome arms, which contain higher recombination rates and a greater density of repressive histone marks. However, these patterns are lost when controlling for expression. Highly transcribed (groups 1 and 2) orphan and homologous genes were more randomly distributed throughout chromosomes, if not slightly biased to be closer toward the centers (Fig. 6). This genome-wide perspective also supports the model that location into open chromatin is a critical factor for origination, or at least transcription, of new genes.

Discussion
Here, we combine the first chromatin state analysis in P. pacificus with taxon-rich nematode phylogenies to analyze the transcriptional regulation of young genes. We identified eight chromatin states that partition the genome into varying levels of repression, transcription, or regulatory elements. Expressed young genes were found in open chromatin states, supporting a widely held model of new gene origination. To our surprise, however, young gene 5′ ends are more similar to enhancers than traditional promoters. We also analyzed young gene transcript structure by long-read Iso-Seq, which revealed a unique signature for each evolutionary gene class. Finally, a bipartite pattern of active histone marks in Chromosome I provides molecular evidence of an ancient chromosomal fusion event ∼180 million years ago. The ability to probe more than 20,000 high-confidence promoters and enhancers will be a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies, especially when combined with the powerful array of genetic, phylogenetic, and ecological tools recently available to P. pacificus.

The origin and subsequent regulation of orphan genes is a widely debated topic that has garnered several theoretical models. Among these are that orphan genes can be transcribed by integrating into open chromatin, or near gene promoters, effectively hijacking their regulatory sequences and thereby mitigating the need to evolve them de novo (Kaessmann et al. 2009; Kaessmann 2010; Tautz and Domazet-Lošo 2011; Chen et al. 2012a,b; Long et al. 2013; McLysaght and Hurst 2016). This model was supported by analyzing the position of transcribed retrogenes in the human genome (Vinckenbosch et al. 2006); however, it was also demonstrated that such integration is often deleterious to the host genes. Indeed, a recent analysis found only ∼14% of mammalian retrogenes utilized preexisting promoters (Carelli et al. 2016). Nevertheless, to date very few tests of these predictions have been performed beyond retrogenes, and the identities of cis-regulatory elements have traditionally been inferred through spatial proximity to genes or known regulatory sequences like TFBSs and CpG islands (Betrán and Long 2003; Carvunis et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2012b; Ni et al. 2012; Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). The phylogenetic diversity of nematode genomes and our recent chromosome-scale genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) allowed us to query all orphan genes in P. pacificus, including but not limited to retrogenes. By applying ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, we could then interrogate the functional P. pacificus genome, including cis and trans enhancers, and up to eight different chromatin states. The data presented herein support a model of orphan gene integration into open chromatin near enhancers preferentially over promoters.

Enhancers were originally thought of as inactive DNA elements that harbor TFBSs (Wasylyk 1988); however, over the last decade, research from several laboratories has shown that enhancers exhibit bidirectional transcription by RNA polymerase (Chen et al. 2013a; Andersson et al. 2014; Lam et al. 2014). Now there is a growing consensus that enhancers and promoters are similar regulatory elements (Andersson et al. 2015; Kim and Shiekhattar 2015), but promoters have evolved additional sequences to enforce directionality (Grzechnik et al. 2014) or increased expression. Indeed, promoters can even function as enhancers for other genes (Engreitz et al. 2016). Under this paradigm, we propose a model whereby a new gene that originates near an enhancer, and is adaptive, will eventually acquire more sophisticated regulatory architecture, thereby transitioning the enhancer into a promoter (Fig. 5C). This model is complimentary to “proto-promoters” proposed by the Kaessmann laboratory for 8%–9% of rat expressed retrogenes that have H3K4me3 enrichment in rats but H3K4me1 enrichment in syntenic nonexpressed regions in mouse (Carelli et al. 2016). However, here we show that proximity of new genes to enhancers correlates with and presumably drives their transcription, and we extend this argument beyond retrogenes as a general feature of new genes. If these transcripts prove functional, then selection can convert the enhancer to a promoter. This model potentially solves two problems faced by new genes: (1) expression via origination near enhancers, and (2) introduction near enhancers, especially trans enhancers, as opposed to promoters, does not require exchange or competition with the preexisting gene landscape. Nevertheless, we caution that such interpretation is speculative at this point, and examining and then experimentally manipulating H3K4me1/3 at syntenic loci in closely related strains and species is necessary to test these hypotheses.

In principle, this model could operate regardless of the method of new gene origination (de novo, duplication and divergence, or retrotransposition). Transcripts from enhancers or lncRNA promoters generally exhibit less splicing, 3′ processing, and polyadenylation relative to protein coding genes (Derrien et al. 2012) and are often digested by the nuclear exosome (Schlackow et al. 2017). In de novo gene evolution, mutations that recruit sequence-specific splicing factors or 3′ processing factors such as CPSF73 could stabilize enhancer transcripts allowing for their translation and potential functionalization. In some cases, a de novo gene that is acting as a functional ncRNA, referred to as “moonlighting,” could lead to greater expression and a greater window of time to accrue such mutations (Jalali et al. 2016). New genes formed by duplication and insertion, or retrotransposition near an enhancer, could similarly be transcribed, but without the parental regulatory architecture. In this new genomic context, the gene will likely be expressed in different developmental stages or tissues, possibly providing new functions. Although misregulation of genes often coincides with deleterious effects and disease (Lee and Young 2013), in this case, the parental gene is still maintained and operating under normal control, while the copied gene is freed, within limits (Geiler-Samerotte et al. 2011), to explore neofunctionalization.

Compared to the current reference annotation (El Paco), our Iso-Seq annotation identified shorter genes with fewer exons. The distribution was more similar to C. elegans gene structures. Nevertheless, we note that there are still substantially more genes in P. pacificus with more than 10 exons compared to C. elegans (Supplemental Fig. S1F), arguing that further refinement is still required (although an evolutionary divergence in gene length is formally possible). We also explored the genetic structure of young versus old genes. Orphan genes displayed the shortest gene lengths and fewest exons, and C. elegans 1:1 orthologs were the longest and contained the most exons. The result that homologs appear to be intermediate in length and exon number is consistent with a transitional path between old and young genes (Carvunis et al. 2012; Abrusán 2013), but whether this indicates divergence from old genes or de novo evolution from young genes is unknown, likely reflecting examples of both. Iso-Seq also identified that almost a quarter (24%) of expressed genes in P. pacificus have multiple isoforms. Although a subset of observed alternative splicing events can be attributed to splicing errors (Pickrell et al. 2010), there are important examples of alternative isoforms that affect diverse biological processes (Baralle and Giudice 2017). Whether the multiplicity of transcripts observed here are differentially expressed during development or in different environmental conditions, and ultimately if they are functional, will be the focus of future experiments.

Iso-Seq of polyadenylated transcripts and rRNA-depleted total RNA demonstrated that most young genes are polyadenylated. In mammals, noncoding RNAs are un- or underpolyadenylated (Derrien et al. 2012), arguing that most new genes in P. pacificus represent coding transcripts. However, retrogene transcripts that contain their polyadenylation “scar” in the genome may be transcribed directly with a poly(A) tail, and thus appear as polyadenylated regardless of whether they have been pseudogenized or not. Nevertheless, our interpretation that they are mostly coding is consistent with a previous investigation of orphan genes in P. pacificus that found appreciable peptide coverage from mass spectrometry and evidence of negative selection (Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Beyond orphan genes, comparing polyadenylated and total RNA Iso-Seq data sets should also be valuable for investigating gene structures of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including antisense ncRNAs that have been shown to affect phenotypic plasticity in P. pacificus (Serobyan et al. 2016).

Genome-wide, we found most young genes are present in chromosome arms where recombination and repressive chromatin in nematodes is the highest (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; Coghlan 2005). However, the ∼10% of young genes that are highly transcribed (expression groups 1 and 2) were more randomly distributed. Thus, although recombination in the arms appears to be a furnace for new gene generation, most of these genes are repressed (expression groups 3 and 4) and have a higher barrier for functionalization. This pattern highlights several unresolved questions. In particular, does the presence in open chromatin reflect rare recombination events or de novo origination? Further, are these transcribed new genes “born” into open chromatin and serve as a template for evolution, or have they already acquired nascent function and their presence in open chromatin is a result of translocation to increase their expression? Additional functional genomic comparisons and synteny analysis may shed light on these questions.

At chromosome-scale resolution, we observed a double-banding of active histone marks on Chromosome I, in contrast to all other autosomes in both P. pacificus and C. elegans (Liu et al. 2011). Based on previous phylogeny and synteny analyses (Rödelsperger et al. 2017), we propose this pattern is a remnant from a fusion event that occurred prior to the split between Diplogasterida and Tylenchida, estimated at ∼180 million years ago (Cutter 2008; Hedges et al. 2015). Then more recently, this portion broke off in the Caenorhabditis lineage. This interpretation parsimoniously explains the long-standing conundrum that Chromosome V in C. elegans has unusual chromosome “arm-like” characteristics, including relatively high recombination rates and a low density of conserved genes (Barnes et al. 1995; The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; Parkinson et al. 2004). In essence, it looks like a chromosome arm because it is, or more precisely, was, prior to breaking off. If true, the remarkable stability of histone mark patterns suggests that chromatin organization per se could serve as a molecular fossil of past genomic rearrangements. Perhaps probing chromatin structure in conjunction with recombination rates could provide a historical record of genome evolution in other nematodes and organisms.

Methods
Evolutionary gene classification
Nematode phylogenies were schematically drawn using data downloaded and analyzed from Holterman et al. (2017) and van Megen et al. (2009). Evolutionary gene classes were defined in a tiered process. First, we defined conserved genes by BLASTP and TBLASTN analyses; we performed all pairwise searches of P. pacificus proteins as query against 24 nematode protein sets as target, and the proteins of each of the 24 nematodes as query against P. pacificus proteins as target. One BLASTP hit (e < 10−3) in any of these 48 comparisons, or one TBLASTN hit (e < 10−5) using P. pacificus proteins as query against any of the 24 nematode species genomes was enough to classify a gene in P. pacificus as conserved. Any gene that did not fit these criteria was defined as a P. pacificus “orphan gene.” Within the conserved gene class, we then defined 1:1 orthologs as having the best reciprocal BLASTP hit (e ≤ 10−3) between C. elegans and P. pacificus (sorted by e-value, and raw scores were used to break ties). Conserved genes that were not in this 1:1 ortholog class but were previously identified by homology in at least one of the 24 nematodes species, were defined as “homologous genes.” We kept the e-value cutoff relatively “high” because of the large phylogenetic distance between C. elegans and P. pacificus, and hence more conservative with respect to our orphan gene lists.

Nematode synchronization and collection
P. pacificus (PS312) cultures for ChIP-, ATAC-, and RNA-seq were synchronized with bleach and grown on agar to young adults following Werner et al. (2017) (Supplemental Methods). Worm pellets were flash-frozen until processing. For Iso-Seq, we used mixed-developmental stage (egg, J2, and J4/young adult) RNA at equimolar ratios.

Native histone ChIP-seq
Native (non-cross-linked) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of histone post-translational modifications was performed by combining nematode nuclear isolation (Steiner et al. 2012) with native ChIP (Brand et al. 2008). Coprecipitated DNA was PCR-amplified and converted to Illumina libraries using the TruSeq Nano kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 3000. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

ATAC-seq
Omni-ATAC-seq was performed on mixed-stage purified nuclei following the Corces et al. (2017) protocol, with a few modifications (Supplemental Methods) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000.

Iso-Seq
RNA was extracted from different developmental time points separately using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), then after the quality control, equal amounts of RNA from different time points were pooled. cDNA synthesis of “direct” Iso-Seq was performed directly using SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories), and “total RNA” was first rRNA-depleted with Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina), then in vitro polyadenylated with Poly(A) Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Direct and rRNA-depleted cDNA were converted into SMRTbell libraries following the guidelines provided by Pacific Biosciences. SMRT Link software version 4.0.0 (Pacific Biosciences) was used to convert subreads to circular consensus sequences and identify full-length nonchimeric reads, which were mapped to the El Paco genome using GMAP (Wu and Watanabe 2005). See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

RNA-seq
Whole-animal young adult (64–68 h post-bleaching) frozen pellets were freeze-thawed 3× in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) before purification, converted to sequencing libraries with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA-seq for Illumina kit, and sequenced on a HiSeq 3000. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

Bioinformatics
All sequencing data were mapped to the El Paco genome assembly (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) using GMAP (Wu and Watanabe 2005) for Iso-Seq, Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) for ChIP- and ATAC-seq, and HISAT2 (Kim et al. 2015) for RNA-seq. Peaks were obtained by MACS2 (Zhang et al. 2008), and only samples containing 50% overlap between replicates were kept. Overlapping peaks were merged using BEDTools (Supplemental Table S1; Quinlan and Hall 2010). Coverage plots were calculated using BEDTools or HOMER (Heinz et al. 2010) with merged replicate files, and plotted in R (R Core Team 2016). Chromatin states were obtained with ChromHMM (Ernst and Kellis 2012) using merged replicate input files. Distances to nearest promoter or enhancers were performed with BEDTools. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed procedure of all bioinformatic steps.
Species-specific, new, or “orphan” genes account for 10%–30% of eukaryotic genomes. Although initially considered to have limited function, an increasing number of orphan genes have been shown to provide important phenotypic innovation. How new genes acquire regulatory sequences for proper temporal and spatial expression is unknown. Orphan gene regulation may rely in part on origination in open chromatin adjacent to preexisting promoters, although this has not yet been assessed by genome-wide analysis of chromatin states. Here, we combine taxon-rich nematode phylogenies with Iso-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to identify the gene structure and epigenetic signature of orphan genes in the satellite model nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Consistent with previous findings, we find young genes are shorter, contain fewer exons, and are on average less strongly expressed than older genes. However, the subset of orphan genes that are expressed exhibit distinct chromatin states from similarly expressed conserved genes. Orphan gene transcription is determined by a lack of repressive histone modifications, confirming long-held hypotheses that open chromatin is important for new gene formation. Yet orphan gene start sites more closely resemble enhancers defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks, in contrast to conserved genes that exhibit traditional promoters defined by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Although the majority of orphan genes are located on chromosome arms that contain high recombination rates and repressive histone marks, strongly expressed orphan genes are more randomly distributed. Our results support a model of new gene origination by rare integration into open chromatin near enhancers.

Gene regulation is a highly orchestrated process that includes transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, and chromatin structure (Voss and Hager 2014). The identification and mechanism of these molecular factors have been revealed for several conserved gene networks leading toward a better understanding of development and disease. But how new genes, also referred to as orphan or taxon-restricted, acquire this complex architecture is unknown. For the increasing number of identified new genes that provide important biological function (Burki and Kaessmann 2004; Cai et al. 2008; Rosso et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2010, 2013b; Reinhardt et al. 2013; Mayer et al. 2015; Santos et al. 2017), the evolutionary path from origin to integration into gene networks depends on their precise transcriptional regulation (Carelli et al. 2016). Yet in the majority of cases, it is unclear how even the most fundamental cis-regulatory elements like promoter and termination sequences are obtained (Tautz and Domazet-Lošo 2011; Long et al. 2013). Orphan genes can originate de novo or by duplication, recombination, or horizontal gene transfer into preexisting regulatory architecture (Betrán and Long 2003; Kaessmann et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Kaessmann 2010; Chen et al. 2012b; McLysaght and Hurst 2016), but the extent to which this occurs is limited by the potential to disrupt the genes already there (Vinckenbosch et al. 2006). In the few cases in which integration has been observed, the presence of nearby regulatory sequences was largely detected by proximity, or sequence homology with known promoters, CpG islands, or TFBSs (Carvunis et al. 2012; Abrusán 2013; Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). Given these constraints, the contribution of preexisting regulatory architecture to new gene transcription is still unknown and, with functional genomic information (e.g., chromatin states and enhancers), could potentially be large. Indeed, a recent analysis of mammalian ChIP-seq data sets found 51% of expressed mouse retrogenes (mRNAs that are reverse transcribed and inserted into the genome) exhibit robust H3K4 trimethylation (Carelli et al. 2016), and transcription of the new gene QQS in Arabidopsis thaliana is inversely correlated with DNA methylation at 5′ transposable elements (Silveira et al. 2013), suggesting an important role for chromatin regulation in new gene transcription. We sought to use the rich taxonomic resources of nematodes to first identify young and old genes, and then observe their regulatory architecture by several genome-wide approaches.

The diplogastrid nematode Pristionchus pacificus can be found in a necromenic relationship with beetles, but has been developed in the laboratory as a satellite model for comparative studies to C. elegans (Fig. 1A–D; Sommer and Streit 2011; Sommer and McGaughran 2013). More recent genetic analysis of dimorphic mouth-forms (Fig. 1E–G) has led to P. pacificus emerging as an important model system for phenotypic plasticity in its own right (Bento et al. 2010; Ragsdale et al. 2013; Kieninger et al. 2016; Serobyan et al. 2016). In addition to the vast taxonomic diversity and corresponding genomes of other nematode species, the recent high-quality chromosome-scale genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) and reverse genetic tools (Witte et al. 2015) in P. pacificus provide a robust framework for studying new genes (Baskaran et al. 2015; Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Here, we probe the gene structure, expression, and regulatory architecture of P. pacificus evolutionary gene classes with long-read Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) transcript sequencing (Iso-Seq), traditional high-depth RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of six histone post-translational modifications and assay for transposon-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). In addition to our findings, the data sets collected provide the first epigenomic map in P. pacificus, which is only the second comprehensive chromatin state annotation in nematodes, creating a resource for future functional and comparative studies.

Comparison of Pristionchus pacificus and Caenorhabditis elegans and phylogenetic relationship. (A,B). P. pacificus is often found in a necromenic relationship with insect hosts, preferentially scarab beetles, in the dormant dauer state. When the beetle dies, worms exit the dauer stage to feed on bacteria that bloom on the decomposing carcass. (C,D) C. elegans, the classic nematode model organism, is often found in leaf detritus and rotting fruits. Example rotting apple photo taken by M.S.W. (E–G) P. pacificus has become an important model for developmental (phenotypic) plasticity. Adults can adopt (E) a narrow mouth form with one tooth (stenostomatous [St]) that makes them strict bacterial feeders. However, the “boom-and-bust” life cycle creates significant competition for resources, and under crowded conditions adults can develop an alternative mouth form (F) with a wider buccal cavity and an extra tooth (eurystomatous [Eu]) that allows them to prey on other nematodes. (G) Shown here is a eurystomatous P. pacificus preying on a C. elegans larva. (H) A schematic phylogeny of nematodes that was generated based on the publications of Holterman et al. (2017) and Van Megen et al. (2009). (I) Breakdown of P. pacificus genes by evolutionary category: One-to-one orthology with C. elegans (C. elegans 1:1) is the most conserved, followed by genes sharing homology with at least one gene from the 24 other nematodes (homologous), and finally genes that are only found in Pristionchus (orphan). All categories were defined by BLASTP homology (e-value ≤0.001) (Methods).

Partitioning of P. pacificus genes into evolutionary classes
The first P. pacificus draft genome published in 2008 (Dieterich et al. 2008) had a large number of genes with undetectable homology. Although the confidence in these gene predictions was initially low, every subsequent refinement of both the genome and gene annotation continually detected 20%–40% of genes that appear as new, orphan, or taxon-restricted (Sinha et al. 2012; Baskaran et al. 2015; Baskaran and Rödelsperger 2015; Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Using our most recent chromosome-scale PacBio genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) and 24 other nematode species, we reevaluated the relative abundance of evolutionary gene classes (Fig. 1H). We defined the most highly conserved genes as having 1:1 orthology with C. elegans (BLASTP e-value ≤ 0.001), which is estimated to have diverged from P. pacificus between 60 to 90 million years ago (Cutter 2008; Rota-Stabelli et al. 2013; Hedges et al. 2015). We also defined an intermediate conserved class as “homologs” if they display homology with at least one gene in the other 24 nematode species (Methods)—which could represent either relatively young genes or old genes that have been lost. Finally, we define “orphan” genes as having no homology with genes in the other 24 queried species. The resulting partition of genes approximates the “30% rule” of new gene composition (Fig. 1I; Khalturin et al. 2009). We then applied several genomic approaches to molecularly characterize each evolutionary gene class.

Characterization of gene structure by long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-Seq)
We sought to improve the overall gene annotation in P. pacificus and then characterize the genetic structure of each evolutionary gene class using PacBio Iso-Seq on mixed-developmental stage RNA (Supplemental Methods; Supplemental Fig. S1A–C). After alignment, we obtained 640,664 reads with a median insert size of 1363 nucleotides (Supplemental Fig. S1D). Despite low read depth compared to conventional RNA-seq, our Iso-Seq data covered 17,307 genes (68% of genes in the reference annotation “El Paco”) (Rödelsperger et al. 2017).

Relative to the current reference annotation, Iso-Seq identified a tighter distribution of gene lengths (median Iso-Seq = 1452 compared to median reference = 1599, P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2A). This difference appears to be due to a more narrow distribution of exons, with 96.5% of Iso-Seq gene annotations containing between 1 and 20 exons, compared to 85.7% for the reference annotation (P = <2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2B). The tighter distribution is also more consistent with the highly curated gene annotation of C. elegans in which 98.0% of genes contain between 1 and 20 exons (Supplemental Fig. S1E,F; Deutsch and Long 1999). This potential improvement in accuracy appears to result from fragmentation of excessively long gene predictions into distinct transcripts (for example, see Supplemental Fig. S1G).

Long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-Seq) improves gene annotation, identifies alternative splicing, and can distinguish different evolutionary gene classes by gene structure. (A) Density distribution of cDNA gene lengths between the El Paco reference (gray) and Iso-Seq annotation (black). The Iso-Seq annotation was derived from guided assembly using StringTie (Pertea et al. 2016; Methods), and plots were created using the density function in R. (B) Density distribution of exons per gene between El Paco reference and Iso-Seq annotations. Method and color scheme are similar to A. (C) Alternatively spliced isoforms, defined as having multiple detected isoforms with the same start and stop coordinates. The white column represents genes containing isoforms that have the same exon–intron structure but different splice sites, and red columns represent genes containing isoforms with different numbers of exons due to intron retention or exon inclusion/exclusion. (D) Example locus of Iso-Seq reads compared to standard short-read RNA-seq. Also shown are Iso-Seq-assembled isoforms compared to the single reference gene umm-S259-11.10-mRNA-1, visualized using Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV). (E,F) Percent coverage of evolutionary gene classes by Iso-Seq with either the “direct” method (E) or rRNA-depleted “total RNA” (F). (G–I) Iso-Seq coverage per gene of each evolutionary class in direct (y-axis) compared to total (x-axis). Coverage was determined by BEDTools, and median ratios of direct/total RNA are presented. Lines (slope = 1, y intercept = 0) represent equal coverage between methods. (J,K) Similar density distributions of cDNA length and exon number as in A and B, but for the three evolutionary gene classes.

Long-read Iso-Seq also provides more robust identification of isoforms, which are historically difficult to assemble from standard short-read RNA sequencing (Conesa et al. 2016). Approximately half (50.6%) of expressed genes in P. pacificus exhibit greater than one isoform, and roughly a third (30.9%) exhibit greater than three isoforms (Supplemental Fig. S1H,I). However, some of these transcripts could be artifacts biased by incomplete coverage of 5′ ends.

Hence, we conservatively defined alternatively spliced isoforms as transcripts with the same start and stop coordinates, but differential exon inclusion or exclusion, intron retention, or differential splice site. Under this classification we observed 3861 (24%) of expressed genes exhibit alternative splicing in P. pacificus (Fig. 2C), similar to the ∼25% of genes estimated in C. elegans (Ramani et al. 2011). As an example, we highlight gene umm-s259-11.10-mRNA, where the majority of Iso-Seq reads (17/19) cover the entire transcript yielding eight isoforms, in stark contrast to standard short-read sequencing, which rarely covers more than three exons per read (Fig. 2D). Collectively, a tighter distribution of transcript lengths and exon numbers, and diversity of isoforms, suggests that Iso-Seq improves the quality and quantity of gene annotation in P. pacificus.

Among evolutionary gene classes, most C. elegans 1:1 orthologs (88%), and approximately half of homologous and orphan genes (46% and 56%, respectively) exhibit Iso-Seq coverage, demonstrating that our Iso-Seq data are sensitive enough to detect thousands of transcripts from each evolutionary gene class (Fig. 2E). We also performed Iso-Seq on rRNA-depleted “total RNA” (Supplemental Methods) to assess whether young genes are un-, or under-polyadenylated, which is typical of noncoding RNAs (Derrien et al. 2012). We found a similar percent coverage from the direct and total RNA methods (Fig. 2E,F) and a consistent polyadenylation read bias for all gene classes (Fig. 2G–I). Hence most young genes, or at least transcribed young genes, are polyadenylated. Because polyadenylation is an important component of transcriptional and translational regulation (Proudfoot et al. 2002; Proudfoot 2011), this argues that most young genes have retained, or already acquired, 3′ termination and processing sequence architecture.

We then used our Iso-Seq annotation to characterize gene length and exon number between evolutionary gene classes. Consistent with other systems (Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Stein et al. 2018), we found a strong bias of C. elegans 1:1 orthologs to be longer and contain more exons than homologs, which in turn were longer and contained more exons than orphan genes (P = <2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 2J,K). The intermediate gene structure of intermediate conserved genes (homologs) is also consistent with a transitional evolutionary path between young and old genes proposed by Carvunis et al. (2012) (Abrusán 2013; Neme and Tautz 2013). In the following sections we seek to characterize and compare the chromatin regulation of young versus old genes.

The P. pacificus epigenome
To identify regulatory regions and expression levels of orphan, homolog, and C. elegans 1:1 orthologs, we performed two to three replicates of ChIP-seq on nine histone modifications and two replicates of RNA-seq in P. pacificus adults, and two replicates of ATAC-seq on mixed-stage cultures (Supplemental Fig. S2; Supplemental Table S3; Supplemental Methods). All data sets showed good correlations between biological replicates (Pearson’s correlation between 0.70–0.93 for ChIP-seq, 0.88 for ATAC-seq, and 0.98 for gene FPKMs in RNA-seq) (Supplemental Fig. S3). We identified enriched regions (i.e., peaks) for each replicate of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq using MACS2 (Methods; Supplemental Table S1; Zhang et al. 2008). H2Bub, H3K9ac, and H3K79me2 exhibited <50% peak reproducibility and were excluded from further analysis (Supplemental Fig. S4A). The majority of remaining samples exhibited >70% overlap between replicates, except for H3K9me3 (54% reproducibility). However, H3K9me3 is a broadly distributed histone modification that is challenging for peak-finding software (Wang et al. 2013), and although most H3K9me3 antibodies are of low specificity (Nishikori et al. 2012; Hattori et al. 2013), they can nevertheless distinguish constitutive versus facultative heterochromatin (Trojer and Reinberg 2007).

We also performed ATAC-seq for identifying regions of open chromatin (Buenrostro et al. 2013). Although the standard protocol led to reproducible peaks, initially we could not identify nucleosomal read density, perhaps suggesting a difficulty of obtaining higher resolution fragments from highly differentiated and heterogeneous cell populations. Yet the new Omni-ATAC method (Corces et al. 2017) yielded nucleosomal and subnucleosomal read densities (Supplemental Fig. S2E), which we used for subsequent analysis.

We clustered the six high-confidence histone marks and Omni-ATAC-seq data using a hidden Markov model (ChromHMM) (Ernst and Kellis 2012) into eight chromatin states (Fig. 3A). Each chromatin state is enriched in histone modifications that define specific functional domains, such as actively transcribed regions, heterochromatin, and regulatory loci. We assigned putative chromatin state annotations based on established classifications (Supplemental Table S2; Fig. 3B; Ernst et al. 2011; Rada-Iglesias et al. 2011). We find that, at least at the whole-animal level, approximately half (57%) of the genome is repressed, approximately a fifth (16%) represents actively transcribed genes, and more than a quarter (27%) is regulatory (including 6785 promoters, 13,648 active enhancers, and 3853 “poised” enhancers) (Fig. 3C).

Darker blue represents greater enrichment. (B) Candidate annotation of each chromatin state according to ENCODE/modENCODE data sets (Ernst et al. 2011; Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al. 2015). Repressive chromatin states are divided into three categories according to standard definitions of constitutive (repressed 3) and facultative (repressed 1 and 2) heterochromatin. Poised enhancers are defined according to previous annotations of loci containing H3K27me3 and DNase sensitivity.

The table also includes the percentage of promoters containing motif, P-value, and matches to known transcription factors. (F,G) Similar to D,E, but for enhancer chromatin states.

Density values measured using HOMER and plotted in Excel. (I) Epigenomic data of histone modification ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq surrounding the Ppa-pax3 gene. Input is included as a reference, and chromatin state annotations are included at the bottom matching the colors in C. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq coverage are autoscaled per sample, and RNA-seq forward (F) and reverse (R) read coverage is in log-scale.

Next, we verified that histone marks are enriched at the center of promoters and active enhancer annotations, and we performed a de novo motif search (Fig. 3D–G; Heinz et al. 2010). Both promoters (30.6%) and enhancers (22.2%) were enriched in a recognition sequence for MBP1, a yeast transcriptional activator that controls cell-cycle progression (Koch et al. 1993). There is weak homology (BlastP, e = 2 × 10−4) with MBP1 in P. pacificus (UMM-S233-5.4-mRNA-1), and in the future it will be interesting to see if this gene is also involved in cell-cycle control. There were also notable differences between enhancers and promoters, including binding site matches to human homeobox, Drosophila GAGA, and eukaryotic GATA transcription factors, demonstrating the precision of promoter and enhancer annotations, and hinting at the existence of deeply conserved regulatory elements.

As expected, promoter annotations were strongly enriched at the 5′ end of genes (Fig. 3H). There was also another peak near the 3′ end of genes. Enhancers were also enriched at both 5′ and 3′ ends, although they are more evenly distributed throughout gene bodies. The existence of promoter/enhancer elements at the 3′ ends of genes has been observed in other species, and although their functions are still unclear, there are several reports supporting promoter-3′-end chromatin looping to facilitate successive rounds of transcription and enforce directionality (O'Sullivan et al. 2004; Lainé et al. 2009; Grzechnik et al. 2014; Werner et al. 2017).

To verify that our chromatin states correlate with a dynamically regulated gene, we looked at Ppa-pax-3, which our laboratory has shown to be expressed in early juvenile stages but is repressed during development (Yi and Sommer 2007). Indeed, we found Ppa-pax-3 is in a large H3K27me3-repressed domain in adults (Fig. 3I). However, we also noticed two putative enhancers after the first exon and 3′ end, perhaps suggesting preparation for activation in developing embryos. Collectively, these data represent the first genome-wide annotation of chromatin regulation in P. pacificus and, to our knowledge, represents only the second comprehensive data set in nematodes.

Chromatin regulation corresponds to gene expression
We extended the previous single gene example to genome-wide high-depth RNA-seq and binned the adult transcriptome into four expression categories (Fig. 4A), then assessed the chromatin states of each. As predicted, gene bodies (exons and introns) of the highest expressed categories (groups 1 and 2) exhibited enrichment in chromatin states designated as “transcriptional transition” and “elongation.” Conversely, repressive chromatin states were virtually absent from genes in the top two categories. In contrast, the two lowest expression categories (groups 3 and 4) exhibited proportionally greater enrichment in repressive chromatin states and decreased enrichment in transcriptional transition and elongation states (Fig. 4B). Although there was a minor enrichment in promoter chromatin states at 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs among high versus low expression categories, there was a larger difference in repressive chromatin states, especially at the 5′ ends. There was also an increase in enhancer enrichment at 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs in the low expression categories, perhaps reflecting a “poised” chromatin state that is reactive to environmental influence. Although promoters and enhancers exhibit a relatively small portion of the genome (15.6%), they comprise the majority of intergenic regions (Fig. 4B), hinting at a large and mostly unexplored regulatory circuitry in the compact nematode genome.

(J) Normalized average densities of H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq over a 7-kb window centered at 5′ ends. Densities were measured in HOMER and normalized to the highest and lowest values in each gene class.

Chromatin regulation of evolutionary gene classes
Next, we assessed the chromatin states of evolutionary gene classes. C. elegans 1:1 orthologs resembled the highest expression categories (groups 1 and 2), whereas conserved and orphan genes more closely resembled the lower expression categories (groups 3 and 4) (Fig. 4C–E). These histone patterns reflect the higher expression of C. elegans 1:1 orthologs compared to less conserved gene classes (Fig. 4F). Nevertheless, we noticed a significant number of orphan and homologous expressed gene outliers (Fig. 4F) and wondered whether their chromatin signatures resembled that of expressed C. elegans 1:1 orthologs. Here, we found differences. Specifically, strongly expressed (groups 1 and 2) orphan and homologous genes, which represent only 9.3% and 12.8% of their respective categories, broadly resembled the general chromatin state pattern of their classes except for having reduced repressive histone marks (Fig. 4G–I). Second, chromatin states 3 and 4, representing transcriptional transition and elongation, are more highly represented in C. elegans 1:1 orthologs compared to expressed orphan and conserved genes. Third, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs exhibit little to no signature of active enhancers (chromatin state 1) at their 5′ ends or 5′ UTRs, which are instead dominated by the promoter chromatin state consisting of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. However, expressed homologous and orphan genes exhibited both promoter and enhancer enrichment at their 5′ ends and 5′ UTRs, and orphan genes, in particular, exhibited greater enrichment in enhancer versus promoter chromatin states.

To investigate this difference more closely, we examined the distribution of histone ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq around the 5′ ends of each evolutionary class. Whereas expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog TSSs are dominated by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, expressed orphan and homologous genes exhibit comparatively stronger enrichment of H3K4me1 and ATAC-seq (Fig. 4J). Specifically, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs exhibit an average 5′ H3K4me3/H3K4me1 ratio of 10.1, compared to 2.4 for homologs and 1.4 for orphan genes. Furthermore, although 54% of expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog 5′ ends are within 1 kb of an annotated promoter, only 27% of expressed homologous genes and 21% of expressed orphan genes are in similar proximity to promoters (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 5A). Conversely, 46% of expressed homologous and orphan gene TSSs are within 1 kb of active and poised enhancers, compared to 33% of expressed C. elegans 1:1 ortholog TSSs (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test for both comparisons) (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the expression of groups 1 and 2 orphan and homologous genes are actually higher than C. elegans 1:1 orthologs (P < 2.2 × 10−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Supplemental Fig. S5), demonstrating that their chromatin architecture is independent of the general correlation with expression. There are two key points from these results. First, the transcription of young genes appears to depend on the absence of repressive heterochromatin, demonstrating a widely held but unconfirmed theory for the requirement of open chromatin in new gene expression. Second, the 5′ end of expressed young genes, especially orphan genes, resemble enhancers rather than canonical promoters.

(A) Distance cumulative frequency distribution of the nearest promoter, or (B) enhancer (active and poised) to transcription start sites (TSSs) from each evolutionary gene category. (C) Model of new gene transcriptional regulation. Enhancers exhibit bidirectional transcription, which can lead to de novo gene expression, or expression of duplications/insertions. If the new gene provides a useful function, selection will occur on not only protein function, but also the gene structure leading to more exons, and on regulatory elements to provide more temporal or spatial control, and more or less transcription. Ultimately, evolution on enhancer sequences will convert it to a traditional promoter.

Genomic position affects chromatin regulation of evolutionary gene classes
Finally, we analyzed the general pattern of chromatin marks and evolutionary gene classes at the chromosomal level (Fig. 6). We observed strong patterns of activating marks in the center of autosomes II–V and the repressive mark H3K27me3 on the chromosome arms. Conversely the X Chromosome was highly enriched in both repressive marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. These patterns have been observed in C. elegans (Liu et al. 2011), and they correspond to general patterns in nematodes of dense clusters of conserved genes and low recombination rates in the center of chromosomes, and species-specific genes and high recombination rates in the chromosome arms (Coghlan 2005). However, Chromosome I in P. pacificus is an exception to other autosomes, in which we observed two bands of activating marks instead of one. Recent analysis suggests that roughly half of P. pacificus Chromosome I is homologous with C. elegans Chromosome X, and the other half is homologous with Chromosome V (Rödelsperger et al. 2017). The P. pacificus chromosome pattern was viewed as ancestral because this organization is also found in the distantly related nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. However, the bipartite presence of histone modifications and conserved genes hints at an ancient chromosomal fusion from an even earlier origin, or frequent and repeated chromosomal fission and fusion events.

Figure 6.
Chromosome-wide distribution of histone modifications reveals distinct patterns for evolutionary gene classes and a double-band pattern on Chr I. Genome-wide patterns of histone modifications from ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq presented as a heatmap with increasing abundance from white to blue, and white to red for RNA-seq (normalized by depth). Also plotted are gene densities of each evolutionary class binned by expressed (groups 1 and 2) or transcriptionally repressed (groups 3 and 4) for each class.

The chromosome-scale distribution of evolutionary gene classes was consistent with histone modification patterns. Specifically, C. elegans 1:1 orthologs, which are strongly expressed, are enriched in the active histone mark chromosome centers. Conversely, the lower expressed homologous and orphan genes are enriched in the chromosome arms, which contain higher recombination rates and a greater density of repressive histone marks. However, these patterns are lost when controlling for expression. Highly transcribed (groups 1 and 2) orphan and homologous genes were more randomly distributed throughout chromosomes, if not slightly biased to be closer toward the centers (Fig. 6). This genome-wide perspective also supports the model that location into open chromatin is a critical factor for origination, or at least transcription, of new genes.

Discussion
Here, we combine the first chromatin state analysis in P. pacificus with taxon-rich nematode phylogenies to analyze the transcriptional regulation of young genes. We identified eight chromatin states that partition the genome into varying levels of repression, transcription, or regulatory elements. Expressed young genes were found in open chromatin states, supporting a widely held model of new gene origination. To our surprise, however, young gene 5′ ends are more similar to enhancers than traditional promoters. We also analyzed young gene transcript structure by long-read Iso-Seq, which revealed a unique signature for each evolutionary gene class. Finally, a bipartite pattern of active histone marks in Chromosome I provides molecular evidence of an ancient chromosomal fusion event ∼180 million years ago. The ability to probe more than 20,000 high-confidence promoters and enhancers will be a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies, especially when combined with the powerful array of genetic, phylogenetic, and ecological tools recently available to P. pacificus.

The origin and subsequent regulation of orphan genes is a widely debated topic that has garnered several theoretical models. Among these are that orphan genes can be transcribed by integrating into open chromatin, or near gene promoters, effectively hijacking their regulatory sequences and thereby mitigating the need to evolve them de novo (Kaessmann et al. 2009; Kaessmann 2010; Tautz and Domazet-Lošo 2011; Chen et al. 2012a,b; Long et al. 2013; McLysaght and Hurst 2016). This model was supported by analyzing the position of transcribed retrogenes in the human genome (Vinckenbosch et al. 2006); however, it was also demonstrated that such integration is often deleterious to the host genes. Indeed, a recent analysis found only ∼14% of mammalian retrogenes utilized preexisting promoters (Carelli et al. 2016). Nevertheless, to date very few tests of these predictions have been performed beyond retrogenes, and the identities of cis-regulatory elements have traditionally been inferred through spatial proximity to genes or known regulatory sequences like TFBSs and CpG islands (Betrán and Long 2003; Carvunis et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2012b; Ni et al. 2012; Ruiz-Orera et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). The phylogenetic diversity of nematode genomes and our recent chromosome-scale genome (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) allowed us to query all orphan genes in P. pacificus, including but not limited to retrogenes. By applying ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, we could then interrogate the functional P. pacificus genome, including cis and trans enhancers, and up to eight different chromatin states. The data presented herein support a model of orphan gene integration into open chromatin near enhancers preferentially over promoters.

Enhancers were originally thought of as inactive DNA elements that harbor TFBSs (Wasylyk 1988); however, over the last decade, research from several laboratories has shown that enhancers exhibit bidirectional transcription by RNA polymerase (Chen et al. 2013a; Andersson et al. 2014; Lam et al. 2014). Now there is a growing consensus that enhancers and promoters are similar regulatory elements (Andersson et al. 2015; Kim and Shiekhattar 2015), but promoters have evolved additional sequences to enforce directionality (Grzechnik et al. 2014) or increased expression. Indeed, promoters can even function as enhancers for other genes (Engreitz et al. 2016). Under this paradigm, we propose a model whereby a new gene that originates near an enhancer, and is adaptive, will eventually acquire more sophisticated regulatory architecture, thereby transitioning the enhancer into a promoter (Fig. 5C). This model is complimentary to “proto-promoters” proposed by the Kaessmann laboratory for 8%–9% of rat expressed retrogenes that have H3K4me3 enrichment in rats but H3K4me1 enrichment in syntenic nonexpressed regions in mouse (Carelli et al. 2016). However, here we show that proximity of new genes to enhancers correlates with and presumably drives their transcription, and we extend this argument beyond retrogenes as a general feature of new genes. If these transcripts prove functional, then selection can convert the enhancer to a promoter. This model potentially solves two problems faced by new genes: (1) expression via origination near enhancers, and (2) introduction near enhancers, especially trans enhancers, as opposed to promoters, does not require exchange or competition with the preexisting gene landscape. Nevertheless, we caution that such interpretation is speculative at this point, and examining and then experimentally manipulating H3K4me1/3 at syntenic loci in closely related strains and species is necessary to test these hypotheses.

In principle, this model could operate regardless of the method of new gene origination (de novo, duplication and divergence, or retrotransposition). Transcripts from enhancers or lncRNA promoters generally exhibit less splicing, 3′ processing, and polyadenylation relative to protein coding genes (Derrien et al. 2012) and are often digested by the nuclear exosome (Schlackow et al. 2017). In de novo gene evolution, mutations that recruit sequence-specific splicing factors or 3′ processing factors such as CPSF73 could stabilize enhancer transcripts allowing for their translation and potential functionalization. In some cases, a de novo gene that is acting as a functional ncRNA, referred to as “moonlighting,” could lead to greater expression and a greater window of time to accrue such mutations (Jalali et al. 2016). New genes formed by duplication and insertion, or retrotransposition near an enhancer, could similarly be transcribed, but without the parental regulatory architecture. In this new genomic context, the gene will likely be expressed in different developmental stages or tissues, possibly providing new functions. Although misregulation of genes often coincides with deleterious effects and disease (Lee and Young 2013), in this case, the parental gene is still maintained and operating under normal control, while the copied gene is freed, within limits (Geiler-Samerotte et al. 2011), to explore neofunctionalization.

Compared to the current reference annotation (El Paco), our Iso-Seq annotation identified shorter genes with fewer exons. The distribution was more similar to C. elegans gene structures. Nevertheless, we note that there are still substantially more genes in P. pacificus with more than 10 exons compared to C. elegans (Supplemental Fig. S1F), arguing that further refinement is still required (although an evolutionary divergence in gene length is formally possible). We also explored the genetic structure of young versus old genes. Orphan genes displayed the shortest gene lengths and fewest exons, and C. elegans 1:1 orthologs were the longest and contained the most exons. The result that homologs appear to be intermediate in length and exon number is consistent with a transitional path between old and young genes (Carvunis et al. 2012; Abrusán 2013), but whether this indicates divergence from old genes or de novo evolution from young genes is unknown, likely reflecting examples of both. Iso-Seq also identified that almost a quarter (24%) of expressed genes in P. pacificus have multiple isoforms. Although a subset of observed alternative splicing events can be attributed to splicing errors (Pickrell et al. 2010), there are important examples of alternative isoforms that affect diverse biological processes (Baralle and Giudice 2017). Whether the multiplicity of transcripts observed here are differentially expressed during development or in different environmental conditions, and ultimately if they are functional, will be the focus of future experiments.

Iso-Seq of polyadenylated transcripts and rRNA-depleted total RNA demonstrated that most young genes are polyadenylated. In mammals, noncoding RNAs are un- or underpolyadenylated (Derrien et al. 2012), arguing that most new genes in P. pacificus represent coding transcripts. However, retrogene transcripts that contain their polyadenylation “scar” in the genome may be transcribed directly with a poly(A) tail, and thus appear as polyadenylated regardless of whether they have been pseudogenized or not. Nevertheless, our interpretation that they are mostly coding is consistent with a previous investigation of orphan genes in P. pacificus that found appreciable peptide coverage from mass spectrometry and evidence of negative selection (Prabh and Rödelsperger 2016). Beyond orphan genes, comparing polyadenylated and total RNA Iso-Seq data sets should also be valuable for investigating gene structures of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including antisense ncRNAs that have been shown to affect phenotypic plasticity in P. pacificus (Serobyan et al. 2016).

Genome-wide, we found most young genes are present in chromosome arms where recombination and repressive chromatin in nematodes is the highest (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; Coghlan 2005). However, the ∼10% of young genes that are highly transcribed (expression groups 1 and 2) were more randomly distributed. Thus, although recombination in the arms appears to be a furnace for new gene generation, most of these genes are repressed (expression groups 3 and 4) and have a higher barrier for functionalization. This pattern highlights several unresolved questions. In particular, does the presence in open chromatin reflect rare recombination events or de novo origination? Further, are these transcribed new genes “born” into open chromatin and serve as a template for evolution, or have they already acquired nascent function and their presence in open chromatin is a result of translocation to increase their expression? Additional functional genomic comparisons and synteny analysis may shed light on these questions.

At chromosome-scale resolution, we observed a double-banding of active histone marks on Chromosome I, in contrast to all other autosomes in both P. pacificus and C. elegans (Liu et al. 2011). Based on previous phylogeny and synteny analyses (Rödelsperger et al. 2017), we propose this pattern is a remnant from a fusion event that occurred prior to the split between Diplogasterida and Tylenchida, estimated at ∼180 million years ago (Cutter 2008; Hedges et al. 2015). Then more recently, this portion broke off in the Caenorhabditis lineage. This interpretation parsimoniously explains the long-standing conundrum that Chromosome V in C. elegans has unusual chromosome “arm-like” characteristics, including relatively high recombination rates and a low density of conserved genes (Barnes et al. 1995; The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; Parkinson et al. 2004). In essence, it looks like a chromosome arm because it is, or more precisely, was, prior to breaking off. If true, the remarkable stability of histone mark patterns suggests that chromatin organization per se could serve as a molecular fossil of past genomic rearrangements. Perhaps probing chromatin structure in conjunction with recombination rates could provide a historical record of genome evolution in other nematodes and organisms.

Methods
Evolutionary gene classification
Nematode phylogenies were schematically drawn using data downloaded and analyzed from Holterman et al. (2017) and van Megen et al. (2009). Evolutionary gene classes were defined in a tiered process. First, we defined conserved genes by BLASTP and TBLASTN analyses; we performed all pairwise searches of P. pacificus proteins as query against 24 nematode protein sets as target, and the proteins of each of the 24 nematodes as query against P. pacificus proteins as target. One BLASTP hit (e < 10−3) in any of these 48 comparisons, or one TBLASTN hit (e < 10−5) using P. pacificus proteins as query against any of the 24 nematode species genomes was enough to classify a gene in P. pacificus as conserved. Any gene that did not fit these criteria was defined as a P. pacificus “orphan gene.” Within the conserved gene class, we then defined 1:1 orthologs as having the best reciprocal BLASTP hit (e ≤ 10−3) between C. elegans and P. pacificus (sorted by e-value, and raw scores were used to break ties). Conserved genes that were not in this 1:1 ortholog class but were previously identified by homology in at least one of the 24 nematodes species, were defined as “homologous genes.” We kept the e-value cutoff relatively “high” because of the large phylogenetic distance between C. elegans and P. pacificus, and hence more conservative with respect to our orphan gene lists.

Nematode synchronization and collection
P. pacificus (PS312) cultures for ChIP-, ATAC-, and RNA-seq were synchronized with bleach and grown on agar to young adults following Werner et al. (2017) (Supplemental Methods). Worm pellets were flash-frozen until processing. For Iso-Seq, we used mixed-developmental stage (egg, J2, and J4/young adult) RNA at equimolar ratios.

Native histone ChIP-seq
Native (non-cross-linked) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of histone post-translational modifications was performed by combining nematode nuclear isolation (Steiner et al. 2012) with native ChIP (Brand et al. 2008). Coprecipitated DNA was PCR-amplified and converted to Illumina libraries using the TruSeq Nano kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq 3000. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

ATAC-seq
Omni-ATAC-seq was performed on mixed-stage purified nuclei following the Corces et al. (2017) protocol, with a few modifications (Supplemental Methods) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000.

Iso-Seq
RNA was extracted from different developmental time points separately using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), then after the quality control, equal amounts of RNA from different time points were pooled. cDNA synthesis of “direct” Iso-Seq was performed directly using SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories), and “total RNA” was first rRNA-depleted with Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina), then in vitro polyadenylated with Poly(A) Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Direct and rRNA-depleted cDNA were converted into SMRTbell libraries following the guidelines provided by Pacific Biosciences. SMRT Link software version 4.0.0 (Pacific Biosciences) was used to convert subreads to circular consensus sequences and identify full-length nonchimeric reads, which were mapped to the El Paco genome using GMAP (Wu and Watanabe 2005). See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

RNA-seq
Whole-animal young adult (64–68 h post-bleaching) frozen pellets were freeze-thawed 3× in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) before purification, converted to sequencing libraries with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA-seq for Illumina kit, and sequenced on a HiSeq 3000. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed protocol.

Bioinformatics
All sequencing data were mapped to the El Paco genome assembly (Rödelsperger et al. 2017) using GMAP (Wu and Watanabe 2005) for Iso-Seq, Bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) for ChIP- and ATAC-seq, and HISAT2 (Kim et al. 2015) for RNA-seq. Peaks were obtained by MACS2 (Zhang et al. 2008), and only samples containing 50% overlap between replicates were kept. Overlapping peaks were merged using BEDTools (Supplemental Table S1; Quinlan and Hall 2010). Coverage plots were calculated using BEDTools or HOMER (Heinz et al. 2010) with merged replicate files, and plotted in R (R Core Team 2016). Chromatin states were obtained with ChromHMM (Ernst and Kellis 2012) using merged replicate input files. Distances to nearest promoter or enhancers were performed with BEDTools. See Supplemental Methods for the detailed procedure of all bioinformatic steps.

Abstract
A central challenge in human genomics is to understand the cellular, evolutionary, and clinical
significance of genetic variants. Here we introduce a unified population-genetic and machinelearning
model, called Linear Allele-Specific Selection InferencE (LASSIE), for estimating the
fitness effects of all potential single-nucleotide variants, based on polymorphism data and predictive
genomic features. We applied LASSIE to 51 high-coverage genome sequences annotated
with 33 genomic features, and constructed a map of allele-specific selection coefficients across all
protein-coding sequences in the human genome. We show that this map is informative about both
human evolution and disease.

Introduction
Innovations in DNA sequencing and genotyping have enabled the discovery of millions of genetic
variants in human populations, with new variants continuing to be discovered at a rapid pace1–4
.
The great majority of these variants, however, are likely to have no impact on cellular function or
human phenotypes, including disease, and many others are probably of only minor importance.
The task of identifying which genetic variants are functionally important remains a major ratelimiting
step in human genetics, with implications for both basic research and clinical practice.
Numerous computational strategies have been developed for the identification of functional
variants, both to prioritize variants for experimental follow-up, and to address broader issues such
as the genetic architecture of disease or the fraction of human nucleotides that are functionally
important5–10. These computational predictors generally leverage genomic features correlated with
function, such as sequence conservation6, 8, 11–13, protein structure14–16, chromatin accessibility17, 18
,
and protein-DNA interactions19, 20. Recently it has been shown that predictive power can be
boosted by considering multiple features together, typically using supervised machine-learning
models such as logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines21–25. These models
detect complex patterns associated with known pathogenic variants and use them to predict the
effects of unannotated variants, often with good accuracy.
Nevertheless, the existing supervised machine-learning predictors suffer from some important
limitations. For example, their predictions are typically hard to interpret, because they reflect
some measure of similarity to a training set of known pathogenic variants based on a complex

statistical model rather than a model formulated in terms of biological principles. In addition,
the “known” disease variants used for training are generally unrepresentative of all pathogenic
variants—e.g., by being enriched for coding regions, splice sites, and well-studied genes23, 26—
which results in training biases and poor generalization. A related problem is that the reported
prediction power for these methods is typically over-optimistic, because it is based on held-out
training data with the same biases26. In general, these methods effectively serve as predictors of
variants like those in the training set, rather than of all functional variants of interest.
An alternative strategy is to identify genetic variants that are subject to purifying (negative)
selection. This approach depends on the assumption that functional and disease-associated variants
are likely to reduce evolutionary fitness, which clearly does not hold in all cases. Nevertheless, this
approach has the important advantages of mitigating the bias from training data and allowing for
more interpretable, evolution-based models. This evolution-based strategy has now been used explicitly
or implicitly by many state-of-the-art variant prioritization methods, including LINSIGHT,
fitCons, CADD, and FunSeq29, 27–32. Among these methods, LINSIGHT and fitCons are based
on explicit evolutionary models and can be used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of interpretable
quantities, such as the per-nucleotide probability that new mutations will have fitness
consequences. These methods perform well in the prioritization of disease and regulatory variants
and also provide evolutionary insights9, 27, but they have some important limitations. For example,
LINSIGHT and fitCons assume that all alternative alleles at each nucleotide have equal effects on
fitness9, 27, 28, 33, and do not provide estimates of true selection coefficients, which arguably provide
the most precisely interpretable description of fitness effects.

A separate thread in the population genetics literature has addressed the problem of estimating
the bulk distribution of fitness effects (DFE) from a designated collection of genomic regions,
such as all coding sequences. Methods for addressing this problem typically calculate the probability
of a summary of polymorphism data, such as the site frequency spectrum (SFS), given an
explicit parameterization of selection coefficients using diffusion approximations of the WrightFisher
model34–40. These methods generally also make use of an explicit model of demographic
history, because of the confounding effect of demography on the SFS36, 37, 41. These DFE inference
methods allow for the inference of true selection coefficients but they are unable to pinpoint the
fitness effects of individual variants owing to the intrinsic sparsity of polymorphisms.
In this article, we present a unified model that combines elements of machine-learning methods
for variant prediction and diffusion-approximation methods for DFE inference to enable estimation
of allele-specific selection coefficients at every nucleotide in a genomic region of interest.
We have implemented our model in a computer program, called Linear Allele-Specific Selection
InferencE (LASSIE), and applied it to all protein-coding sequences in the human genome, using
publicly available human polymorphism data and more than two dozen predictive genomic features.
We validate LASSIE by comparing the estimated selection coefficients with known patterns
of natural selection in coding regions and by testing their predictive power for inherited pathogenic
variants and cancer-driver mutations. We then show that LASSIE can be used to define a “null”
distribution for the relationship between genomic features and selective effects, which enables the
identification of genes under unusually strong or unusually weak selection. Genes under unusually
strong selection are associated with brain-specific expression and autism spectrum disorder.

Results
LASSIE uses a unified machine-learning and population genetic model to estimate allelespecific
selection coefficients. The key idea behind the LASSIE model is that, while polymorphisms
are too sparse to allow direct estimation of allele-specific selection coefficients, there is a
strong correlative relationship between genomic features and fitness effects that can be exploited to
enable such estimation. The general idea is similar to that behind fitCons9, 28 and LINSIGHT27, but
in this case a richer machine-learning model accommodates allele-specific effects and a diffusionbased
likelihood function allows for the estimation of true selection coefficients.
The LASSIE model consists of two components (Fig. 1). First, for the population genetic
component of the model, we use a generative probabilistic model for the site frequency spectrum
(SFS), adopting the Poisson Random Field (PRF) framework for direct likelihood calculations34, 42, 43
.
Second, we account for predictive genomic features using a neural network. The output of this network
is not a class assignment, as in typical supervised-learning applications, but instead is a set of
parameters that feed into the PRF model for likelihood calculations. Thus, the overall model is a
generative model for the data, fitted in an unsupervised manner by maximization of the likelihood,
but it conditions on a potentially large, complex, and informative set of genomic features using a
neural network. This conditioning allows for pooling of data across genomic sites, and improved
shrinkage estimators for allele-specific selection coefficients.
Population genomic data is described using a PRF-based mixture model. For reasons of efficiency,
selection is accommodated using a three-component mixture model rather than a contin5

uous distribution of selection coefficients. The mixture components capture the average effects
of strong negative selection, weak negative selection, and neutral drift, respectively. The use of a
mixture model allows the full PRF model to be fitted to the data in a preprocessing step, so that
only the site-specific probabilities of the mixture components (the mixture coefficients) need to be
estimated in the context of the neural network (see below).
To account for the confounding influence of demography on the SFS, we first fitted a simple
demographic model to a collection of putatively neutrally evolving nucleotide sites flanking
protein-coding exons. We focused on the 51 high-coverage Yoruba samples from the 1000
Genomes Project, because this population appears to be well described by a pure “expansion”
model, without population bottlenecks or introgression events34, 37, 39. We assumed a three-epoch
model with a constant effective population size in each epoch, and we estimated the timings and
magnitudes of population expansions by maximum likelihood (Methods). The estimated model
posits that the Yoruba population experienced a moderate expansion about 6000 years ago, followed
by a more dramatic expansion about 600 years ago (Fig. 1b). Despite its simplicity, this
demographic model provides an excellent fit to the observed SFS (Supplementary Fig. 1).
We then fitted a mixture model to genome-wide protein-coding sequence data, estimating
the three mixture coefficients as well as the selection coefficients for the weak and strong negative
selection components but keeping the neutral model fixed. This analysis indicates that ∼10% of
potential coding mutations in the human exome are under weak negative selection with a representative
selection coefficient of s = −1.30 × 10−4
and about 51% of coding mutations are under
strong negative selection with a representative selection coefficient of s = −5.86×10−4
(Fig. 1b).

We found that this mixture model also fit the exome-wide SFS well (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Genomic features are incorporated using a mixture density network model. We modeled the
relationship between genomic features and allele-specific probabilities of selection components
using a mixture density network model44. This model transforms the genomic features associated
with each allele to site- and allele-specific mixture coefficients (Fig. 1c). These mixture coefficients,
in turn, can be used to compute the probability of the exome-wide data under the PRF
mixture model. Thus, the edge weights in the neural network function as the free parameters of a
generative model for population genomic data conditional on genomic features.
Hypothesizing that genomic features used in variant prioritization would also be informative
in this context, we collected 33 diverse features for every potential derived mutation in the human
exome, including protein conservation scores, nucleotide conservation scores, protein structural
features, RNA-seq signals, and categories indicating changes in the encoded protein (nonsynonymous,
nonsense, stop-gained; Fig. 1a; see Supplementary Table 1 for a complete list of features).
We then fitted the mixture density model to the exome-wide data by maximum likelihood, keeping
the selection coefficients fixed at their previously estimated values (see Methods). The features
most strongly predictive of selection included stop-gain and missense mutations, several measures
of phylogenetic conservation, and several features describing structural properties of amino acid
substitutions such as whether the affected reside is buried or exposed, or whether the substitution is
predicted to stabilize or destabilize folding45 (Supplementary Fig. 2). For ease of interpretation,
we summarized the probabilities of neutrality, weak negative, and strong negative selection for
each candidate mutation by the absolute value of the expected selection coefficient, |s|.

Notice that our general framework allows for a variety of network architectures, ranging
from many-layered networks to the simple case of no hidden layers. The use of hidden layers
provides the potential to capture nonlinear relationships between genomic features and selection
coefficients, but at the cost of larger numbers of free parameters and increased risk of overfitting.
In our tests, we found that a linear model actually fit the data better than a nonlinear one
(Supplementary Table 2), so we have adopted this simple “linear” architecture for LASSIE.
The estimated selection coefficients are consistent with known evolutionary patterns but suggest
pervasive weak selection against synonymous mutations. The selection coefficients estimated
by LASSIE are highly variable across potential mutations (see Fig. 2a & b). As expected,
LASSIE assigns larger values of |s| to nonsynonymous and nonsense mutations than to synonymous
mutations. Because synonymous mutations tend to occur at third codon positions, the spatial
distribution of allele-specific selection coefficients exhibits a general three-nucleotide periodic pattern
in coding regions. Inspection of individual genes reveals that LASSIE frequently distinguishes
known pathogenic variants (shown in red, with relatively large estimates of |s|, in Fig. 2a & b) from
benign variants (shown in blue, with small estimates of |s|).
Overall, the distribution of |s| recapitulates well-known patterns of constraint on coding sequences.
For example, LASSIE predicts that most nonsense mutations are under strong negative
selection (Fig. 2c). In contrast, nonsynonymous mutations show a bimodel distribution of selection
coefficients, with modes corresponding to strong and weak negative selection (Fig. 2c). While
coarse-grained and truncated at our estimate for strong negative selection (see Discussion), this
distribution is reasonably consistent with the bulk distribution inferred in a non-site- and allele8

specific manner in previous studies; for example, we estimate that an expected 45% of nonsynonymous
mutations are under neutral or weak negative selection (|s| ≤ 1.3 × 10−4
in our formulation)
in comparison to estimates of ∼30% with |s| ≤ 1.0 × 10−4
in ref. 37. In agreement with previous
analyses based on codon substitution models46, we also find that nonsynonymous mutations
in highly expressed genes are under significantly stronger negative selection than nonsynonymous
mutations in genes expressed at lower levels (Fig. 2d).
Interestingly, the distribution of |s| for synynomous mutations suggests that only an expected
70.5% of such mutations are effectively neutral, whereas 25.9% are under weak negative selection
and 3.6% are under strong negative selection (Fig. 2c). Weak negative selection on synonymous
mutations is significantly elevated in highly expressed genes, multi-exon genes, and SRSF1 and
SRSF7 binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that roles in mRNA splicing contribute
to it, perhaps among other features. This finding of a substantial influence from weak negative
selection on synonymous substitutions is consistent with studies showing reduced substitution rates
or reduced nucleotide diversity at synonymous sites relative to pseudogenes or introns47–52 and
suggests that the widespread practice of using such mutations as a proxy for neutral evolution49, 53
could result in major biases in downstream analyses (see Discussion).
The estimated selection coefficients are predictive of mutations associated with Mendelian
diseases and cancer. While LASSIE was designed as an evolutionary measure, it may also be
useful in the prediction of mutations associated with disease, assuming such mutations tend to be
under selection11, 12, 27, 29, 30. To evaluate the method in this setting, we measured its power in the
prediction of known Mendelian disease variants, comparing it with the popular variant prioritiza9

tion methods PolyPhen-221, SIFT11, Eigen54, CADD29, and phyloP8
. In this experiment, we used
pathogenic and benign variants from the ClinVar database55 as positive and negative examples,
respectively. Despite no use of disease data for training (see Discussion), LASSIE performed remarkably
well on this benchmark (Fig. 3a), displaying slightly greater values of the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic (AUC=0.879) than even the best previously
published methods, such as Eigen (AUC=0.867) and PolyPhen-2 (AUC=0.845).
As a second, largely orthogonal, test of predictive power for clinically relevant variants,
we evaluated LASSIE’s performance in the prioritization of nonsynonymous cancer-driver mutations.
Cancer-driver mutations in germline cells may significantly increase the risk of early-onset
malignant tumors and, therefore, are likely to be under strong purifying selection in human populations.
To test this hypothesis, we obtained a set of nonsynonymous mutations overlapping with
mutational hotspots recurrently observed across patients in 243 cancer genes56, which should be
enriched for cancer drivers. We randomly sampled a matched number of singleton nonsynonymous
somatic mutations in the same genes to represent putative passenger mutations. LASSIE showed
reasonable accuracy in this task (AUC=0.743), again performing better than all other methods
tested, although the overall power was modest for all predictors (Fig. 3b). Nevertheless, the selection
coefficients estimated by LASSIE are significantly predictive of cancer-driver mutations and
could potentially be combined with other features to improve predictive power.
To examine disease relevance at higher resolution, we compared our estimates of |s| with
a recent saturation genome editing (SGE) study of 13 exons of the BRCA1 gene57. This study
assigned nearly every possible single nucleotide variant (SNV) in these exons a “function score”

indicating its effect on cell growth in an optimized HAP1 cell line, and then classified each SNV
as “non-functional” (i.e., disruptive to growth), “functional” (nondisruptive), or “intermediate.”
We found that “non-functional” variants had mostly high estimates of |s|, “functional” variants
were enriched for medium and low estimates of |s|, and “intermediate” variants had intermediate
estimates of |s| (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the 20 “pathogenic” variants from ClinVar that have been
reviewed by experts almost all were both classified by SGE as “nonfunctional” and had close to
the maximum possible estimate of |s|, whereas the 12 expert-reviewed “benign” variants from
ClinVar were almost all “functional” and tended to have low to moderate estimates of |s| (Fig. 3c).
Indeed, a threshold of |s| = 0.0005 (dotted line) would almost perfectly distinguish between the
pathogenic and benign variants in ClinVar, with only three misclassifications (see Supplementary
Fig. 4 for ROC curves). Nevertheless, many “functional” variants appear to be under fairly strong
selection, and some “non-functional” variants under fairly weak selection, indicating that there are
fundamental limits to the use of natural selection as an indicator for disease (see Discussion).
LASSIE and other methods have reasonable accuracy for rare but not common GWAS variants.
Because rare genetic variants are most likely to be under negative selection, we hypothesized
that evolution-based methods would be more predictive of rare than common variants associated
with complex traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested several methods separately on rare
(MAF < 1%) and common (MAF > 5%) nonsynonymous variants from the GWAS catalog58
,
using matched variants from the 1000 Genomes Project as negative controls (Methods). In agreement
with our hypothesis, most predictors were significantly more powerful in the prediction of
rare GWAS variants than of common variants (Fig. 3d–e). Furthermore, LASSIE was among the

most accurate methods in the prioritization of both rare and common GWAS variants.
Brain-specific and autism spectrum disorder-related genes are under unusually strong selection.
LASSIE’s assumption of a single shared relationship, across all genes, between predictive
genomic features and |s| may fail for certain subsets of genes. We searched for groups of genes
that systematically deviate from this average relationship, using rare variants from 60,706 exomes
in the ExAC data set to obtain high-resolution information about strong negative selection4, 59. To
characterize the “null” distribution for the observed number of nonsynonymous variants per gene,
we used a previously estimated context-dependent mutation rate map60 to describe site-specific
mutation rates. This model predicted numbers of rare synonymous variants that were generally
well correlated with the observed data (Supplementary Fig. 5). We then combined these sitespecific
mutation rates with the probabilities of strong negative selection under LASSIE to obtain
an expected rate of rare nonsynonymous variants per each gene. Finally, we computed p-values
for the observed numbers of rare (MAF < 0.001) nonsynomous variants per gene with respect to
these expected rates under a Poisson-Binomial model (see Methods). We refer to the genes having
significantly fewer variants than expected as being under enhanced selection, and the genes with
significantly more variants than expected as being under relaxed selection.
Among 11,602 autosomal genes examined, we identified 1,118 genes and 773 genes as being
under significantly enhanced or relaxed selection, respectively (Fig. 4a; FDR rate < 0.001). Interestingly,
we found that the genes under enhanced (strong negative) selection were more likely to
be exclusively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) or associated with autism spectrum
disorder61, 62 (Fig. 4b). These genes were also enriched in Gene Ontology terms and pathways

associated with the CNS63 (Supplementary Tables 3 & 4). The genes under relaxed selection, by
contrast, tended to be exclusively expressed in liver or skeletal muscle (Fig. 4b) and to be involved
in fundamental metabolic pathways (Supplementary Tables 5 & 6).
Discussion
In this article, we have introduced LASSIE, the first computational method for estimating allelespecific
selection coefficients at individual nucleotides across the human genome. LASSIE unifies
ideas from the literature on variant prioritization and the literature on the bulk distribution of fitness
effects (DFE). Like most methods for DFE inference, LASSIE is based on a generative model for
allele frequencies, which can be fitted to the data by maximum likelihood without the need for
labeled training data. At the same time, the LASSIE model is explicitly conditioned on a rich set
of genomic features similar to those considered by variant prioritization methods. Using a flexible
neural-network design, LASSIE pools polymorphism data across sites having similar genomic
features to obtain improved estimates of selection coefficients. We have used LASSIE to generate
a map of |s| for all possible single nucleotide variants in human protein-coding genes (available as
a UCSC Genome Browser track: http://compgen.cshl.edu/LASSIE/), based on 51 high-coverage
Yoruba genomes and 33 predictive genomic features.
For reasons of efficiency, we chose to approximate the full DFE using a mixture model, with
components corresponding to neutral drift, weak negative, and strong negative selection. This
strategy allows the model to be rapidly fitted to genome-wide data, but results in a rather coarsegrained
estimate of the DFE. In our formulation, this approach ignores positive selection, which

we have previously shown is difficult to detect in this setting9
. Importantly, this strategy is also limited
in its ability to make distinctions among large values of |s|, because estimates are effectively
truncated at the value for the “strong” mixture component, |s| = 5.9 × 10−4
. As a result, LASSIE
appears to substantially underestimate |s| for nonsense mutations, for which the true value may
be as much as two orders of magnitude larger64. A related problem is that our analysis is based
on only 51 genome sequences, whereas more precise estimates will depend on much larger data
sets (ref. 64 considered >60,000 exomes). In principle, our framework could be extended to infer
full continuous distributions of s from larger data sets, but such an extension would require a
number of technical improvements, including relaxation of the infinite-sites assumption underlying
our model for the site frequency spectrum, accurately accounting for the effects of very recent
explosive population growth4, 65, and further improvements to computational efficiency.
Strikingly, we find that about 30% of synonymous mutations are under negative selection.
Selection on synonymous mutations appears to be almost exclusively weak, rather than strong,
suggesting a limited impact on disease. Nevertheless, weak selection will tend to prohibit the
fixation of synonymous alleles and will reduce synonymous substitution rates. Indeed, at a selection
coefficient of s = −1.3 × 10−4
(our estimate for the corresponding mixture component),
nearly all selected synonymous mutations would eventually be lost, rather than fixed, causing the
observed synonymous substitution rate to be reduced by almost 30% relative to the neutral rate.
This projection is consistent with a number of previous analyses of human and other mammalian
data47–52, which have observed reductions of ∼20–40% in substitution rates or nucleotide diversity
at synonymous sites. Overall, it appears that negative selection on synonymous mutations is far

more common than once believed, even in humans, with important implications for the widespread
practice of using synonymous sites to estimate the neutral substitution rate.
The value of evolutionary methods for disease prediction ultimately depends on the degree to
which natural selection correlates with disease risk. While many disease-associated variants show
signatures of selection, it stands to reason that some will not, for example, because they are associated
with late-onset diseases or diseases whose prevalence is strongly associated with features of
modern life. Conversely, many potential variants that show signatures of selection will not relate to
disease, for example, because they are strongly deleterious at embryonic or even pre-fertilization
(e.g., in sperm competition) stages and never appear in patients; because they are deleterious only
in the presence of a no-longer-existing genetic background; or because they reduce fitness without
disrupting normal health (as through sexual selection). Nevertheless, the relationship between natural
selection and Mendelian disease is sufficiently strong that evolutionary methods are fairly effective
at identifying pathological variants in databases such as ClinVar, with LASSIE performing
as well or better, in our experiments, than any other available computational method—including
well-established methods such as PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. Interestingly, LASSIE also significantly
outperformed other methods in the prioritization of nonsynonymous cancer-driver mutations, despite
not being designed for the unique features of somatic evolution.
We found that recently published measures of the functional impact of point mutations in
BRCA1 based on saturation genome editing (SGE)57 correlated fairly well with LASSIE’s measure
of natural selection, both across all mutations and for the subset in ClinVar (Fig. 3c). Nevertheless,
an expected 44% of variants considered “functional” (i.e., non-disrupting) by SGE were estimated

by LASSIE to be under strong negative selection and 9% of “non-functional” mutations were
estimated to be under only weak selection. These discordances could in part reflect the influence
of natural selection in other cell types or conditions, or limitations of the assay as a measure of
disease importance. In any case, they suggest—based on this one gene, cell type, and functional
assay—that while there is a strong positive correlation between signatures of natural selection and
disease impact, there are nevertheless many exceptions to this general correspondence.
While evolutionary methods clearly have value in predicting Mendelian disease variants, it
is less clear that they will be useful for identifying causal variants for complex diseases or other
complex traits, many of which segregate at high frequencies, making them unlikely to be under
detectable negative selection. Indeed, we found that none of the variant prioritization methods we
tested performed well in common variant prediction (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, however, LASSIE and
other evolution-based methods performed much better for rare variants associated with complex
traits (Fig. 3d), presumably because rare variants tend to have larger effect sizes and experience
stronger negative selection. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the effect sizes of GWAS
variants are negatively correlated with allele frequencies and allele ages66, 67. Together, these observations
suggest that evolution-based methods may have an under-appreciated potential for the
identification of rare variants associated with complex traits.
We were able to obtain reasonable estimates of allele-specific selection coefficients by pooling
data across many genes, thereby “shrinking” estimates toward their average values given the
genomic features. As in all such shrinkage strategies, however, the decreased variance in the estimates
comes at the cost of increased bias, which will be most evident for genes that are atypical

in some way. We attempted to turn this limitation into a strength by using it to reveal classes
of genes that showed unusually large or small numbers of variants relative to the LASSIE predictions,
corresponding to “enhanced” or “relaxed” strong negative selection. Interestingly, we
found that genes under “enhanced” selection are enriched for brain-specific expression and an
association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This observation is consistent with a reported
enrichment for likely gene-disrupting de novo mutations in ASD-affected probands relative to unaffected
siblings, suggesting the existence of ∼400 ASD-associated genes under particularly strong
selection68–71. Separately, conventional variant-effect predictors have been reported to perform
poorly for neurodevelopmental diseases, while gene-level estimates of natural selection—such as
pLI and RVIS—perform considerably better59, 72, 73, perhaps because the relevant genes are not
extraordinarily conserved across species but are under very strong selection in humans. Our findings
help to put these observations in an evolutionary context, and suggest that extensions of our
methods that unify variant- and gene-level measures of selection could be particularly useful for
neurodevelopmental diseases.

Online Methods
Genomic features. For predictive genomic features, we used predefined variant categories indicating
the impact of each mutation on the encoded protein, sequence conservation scores, protein
structural features, splicing scores, and RNA-seq signals (Supplementary Table 1). The variant
categories were defined by three indicator variables for whether or not a variant was nonsynonymous,
nonsense (stop-gained), or stop-lost in dbNSFP74. The conservation scores include scores
derived from both protein and multi-species genomic alignments. The protein sequence conservation
scores included SIFT11, LRT75, Mutation Assessor76, PROVEAN77, SLR78, Grantham79, PSIC
scores from PolyPhen-2 (ref. 21), and HMMEntropy scores from SNV-Box45. The nucleotide sequence
conservation scores included phyloP scores8 derived from vertebrate, mammalian, and
primate whole-genome alignments from the UCSC Genome Browser80. The protein structural
features were obtained from SNV-Box and included predicted secondary structures, and contributions
to protein stability, B-factors, and relative solvent accessibilities45. We also obtained splicing
scores and RNA-seq signals from the non-commercial version of SPIDEX and the Roadmap Epigenomics
Project, respectively81, 82. All features were based on the hg19 (GRCH37) assembly of the
human genome.
Polymorphism data. We obtained 51 high-coverage Yoruba genome sequences from the 1000
Genomes project1
. To reduce technical errors due to alignment and genotype calling, we applied
several filters similar to those used in refs. 33 & 83. These filters eliminated multi-allelic nucleotide
sites, simple repeats, transposons, and recent segmental duplicates. Following the same references,

we masked all CpG dinucleotides present in either the reference genome or alternative alleles.
We also obtained the distributions of ancestral alleles in the human-chimp most recent common
ancestor from these same previous studies. In this case, we integrated over these distributions when
inferring the global demographic model and mixture model for selection, but then conditioned on
the most likely ancestral alelle in the mixture density network for simplicity and efficiency.
Demographic model and exome-wide distribution of selection coefficients. To obtain sites
largely free from selection, we began with the putatively neutral regions defined for INSIGHT33, 83
.
Briefly these regions are defined by excluding all coding exons, conserved noncoding elements,
and their close flanking regions. We intersected these regions with the 2-kb flanking regions of
all coding exons in the Consensus CDS database84 to obtain a subset of putatively neutral sites
proximal to coding exons and therefore approximately matched to them in terms of influence from
selection from linked sites. We fitted a three-epoch demographic model to the site-frequency spectrum
in these exon-proximal “neutral” regions, using Poisson Random Field (PRF) theory for
inference (see Supplementary Note for details).
We then estimated the bulk distribution of selection coefficients in coding regions under a
three-component mixture model, with components for neutral evolution (s0 = 0), weak negative
selection (s1 < 0), and strong negative selection (s2 < s1). This model is defined by the selection
coefficients {s0, s1, s2} and three corresponding mixture coefficients, {w0, w1, w2}, where wi
represents the probability that each mutation belongs to component i of the model. The free parameters
{s1, s2, w0, w1, w2} were estimated by maximum likelihood, subject to the constraints
that w0 + w1 + w2 = 1, {w0, w1, w2} ≥ 0, with s0 = 0 held fixed (Supplementary Note).

Training the mixture density model. We trained the mixture density network for inference of
allele-specific selection coefficients using mini-batch gradient descent. Data for chromosome 1
was used for testing, data for chromosome 2 was used for validation, and data from the remaining
chromosomes was used for training, except for the sex chromosomes (X & Y), which were excluded
due to their atypical patterns of mutation and selection, as in previous work. The batch-size
was set to 100 nucleotides and the training data were shuffled prior to processing. After each epoch
of training, we evaluated the model on the validation set (chromosome 2) and stopped training if
the loss (negative log likelihood) did not decrease after five successive epochs (early stopping). Finally,
we selected the set of parameters estimated in the epoch with the lowest validation loss. After
training, we assigned each potential coding mutation its expected selection coefficient s under the
site- and allele-specific distribution defined by the mixture density network, that is, with,
s = Pneutrals0 + Pweaks1 + Pstrongs2
= Pweaks1 + Pstrongs2, (1)
(see Fig. 1c). By construction, s ≤ 0, so we generally summarize these estimates using |s|, which
can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of negative selection. Despite that chromosome X
was excluded from the training set, we did generate predictions for this chromosome because it
contains many disease variants.
Comparison with other variant prioritization methods. For comparison with LASSIE, we
downloaded precomputed CADD (v1.3; ref. 29), PolyPhen-2 (v2.2.2; ref. 21), SIFT (released in
August 2011; ref. 11), Eigen (v1.0; ref. 54), and mammalian phyloP (phyloP46way; ref. 8) scores
from their source websites. For all comparisons, we only included variants which were scored by

all methods. We visualized the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using the ROCR package in R85
.
For the evaluation of Mendelian disease variants, we obtained pathogenic and benign variants
from the ClinVar website55 in March 2017. Variants annotated as “pathogenic” or “likely
pathogenic” were considered “true” disease variants, whereas those annotated as “benign” or
“likely benign” were employed as negative controls (ClinVar release in March 2017; ref. 55).
Notably, several of the evaluated methods utilized common SNPs or known pathogenic variants
in training, which could result in overestimation of their performance. Therefore, we removed all
ClinVar variants also in the 1000 Genomes project (phase 3; ref. 1) or the training set of PolyPhen2.
The numbers of positive and negative control variants were balanced by random sampling
without replacement. Because true pathological variants are sparse, this matching scheme will
tend to result in an over-estimate of the true absolute AUC, but our focus in this article is on the
relative performance of the different predictors.
For the evaluation of cancer-driver mutations, we obtained pan-cancer somatic mutations and
hotspots of nonsynonymous mutations from ref. 56. We defined cancer genes to be protein-coding
genes containing at least one mutational hotspot, cancer-driver mutations to be somatic mutations
overlapping mutational hotspots, and passenger mutations to be singleton mutations within cancer
genes but not overlapping mutational hotspots. As above, we filtered out all somatic mutations
overlapping 1000 Genomes Project variants or the training set of PolyPhen-2, and matched the
numbers of cancer diver mutations and passenger mutations by random sampling without replacement.

For the evaluation of nonsynonymous variants associated with complex traits or diseases, we
obtained GWAS variants from the GWAS Catalog58 (downloaded in November 2017) and identified
subsets of rare variants (MAF < 0.01) and common variants (MAF > 0.05). We used nonsynonymous
variants from the 1000 Genomes Project as negative controls. After observing that the
GWAS variants tended to have higher MAFs than these controls, we matched the distributions of
MAFs for the two sets and then randomly sampled negative examples matched in both number and
MAF to the GWAS variants, repeating the sampling 100 times to quantify uncertainty.
Identification of genes under enhanced or relaxed selection. Our model for the expected rates
of ultra-rare (MAF < 0.001) variants in the ExAC data4 depended critically on an accurate mutation
model. Our mutation model was based on precomputed context-dependent mutation rates
from the website of the Genome of the Netherlands60, 86. Because of differences in sample size,
we expected that the local mutation rates in the ExAC data would be proportional, but not equal,
to the rates estimated from the Genomes of the Netherlands data. Therefore, to recalibrate the
local mutation rates, we fitted a simple logistic regression model for the entire genome based on
the numbers of ultra-rare synonymous variants in the ExAC data set, assuming that the impact of
natural selection on these variants should be minimal. (Note that our finding that few synonymous
mutations are under strong negative selection, Fig. 2b, supports this assumption.) Specifically, the
logistic regression assumes,

is the corresponding mutation rate estimated by the Genomes of the Netherlands. We validated
the mutational model by comparing the observed number of synonymous mutations with the expected
number predicted by the mutational model for each gene. We removed short genes (with
<200 potential synonymous mutations) and genes for which the mutational model seemed to be
misspecified (FDR rate ≤ 0.2) from further consideration.
Based on this recalibrated mutation model, we defined a null model for the number of nonsynonymous
mutations per gene given the site- and allele-specific selection coefficients estimated
by LASSIE. First, we calculated qi
, the expected probability of observing a nonsynonymous mutation
i, as
qi = h(w2,i)pi
, (3)
where pi
is the probability of mutation i under the neutral mutational model, w2,i is the probability
that mutation i is under strong selection as estimated by LASSIE, and h(·) is a mapping from
the probabilities of strong selection to relative rates of the nonsynonymous mutation in the ExAC
data. To estimate h(·), we grouped all potential nonsynonymous mutations into 1000 equal-width
bins based on w2,i and then estimated h(·) for each selection bin by calculating the ratio of the
observed to the expected numbers of nonsynonymous mutations. We then calculated qi for each
nonsynonymous mutation i and used qi
to parameterize a Poisson-Binomial distribution describing
the null distribution of the number of nonsynonymous mutations for each gene. The probability
mass function of the Poisson-Binomial model for a single gene is given by,

were identified by two separate one-tail tests based on this Poisson-Binomial distribution.
Gene enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis of tissue-specific expression was based on
annotated tissue-specific genes from the Human Protein Atlas61. Only tissues having more than 50
tissue-specific genes were included. The analysis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was based on
ASD-related genes from the SFARI Gene database62. In both cases, significant enrichments were

Figure 1: Overview of LASSIE. (a) For each potential protein-coding mutation, we collected
33 genomic features likely to be informative about natural selection, including variant categories,
protein and nucleotide conservation scores, and RNA-seq signals (Supplementary Table 1). (b)
A three-epoch demographic model was fitted to the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) for putatively
neutral exon-flanking sequences for 51 high-coverage Yoruba genomes sequences. A mixture
model for neutral evolution (s = 0), weak negative (s = −1.30 × 10−4
), and strong negative (s =
−5.86 × 10−4
) selection was then fitted to the SFS for coding sequences (CDS; see Methods). (c)
A mixture density network model defines the probabilities of the three components of the mixture
model (Pneutral, Pweak, and Pstrong) for each possible mutation at each nucleotide site, conditional
on the local genomic features. These probabilities allow the likelihood of the polymorphism data
to be computed under the Poisson Random Field (PRF) model, using diffusion approximation
methods. The parameters of the network are estimated by maximum likelihood, by treating the
(negative) log likelihood as a loss function for the neural network. After training, the weights for
the three mixture components define a coarse-grained distribution of fitness effects for all potential
mutations at each site. This distribution is summarized by a single expected value of |s| for each
mutation.

Figure 2: Distributions of selection coefficients estimated by LASSIE. (a) Variant-specific selection
coefficients |s| estimated for all potential mutations in a 60-bp region in the CP gene. Nonreference
alleles are distinguished by color and drawn with height proportional to |s|. The y-axis
indicates cumulative |s|. The three nonsynonymous variants indicated at top in red (c.2953A>G,
c.2962G>A, and c.2991T>G) are associated with Mendelian diseases and the synonymous variant
indicated in blue (c.2991T>C) is benign. (b) Estimates of |s| for all potential mutations in
a 72-bp region in the BRCA1 gene. The two nonsynonymous variants indicated at top in red
(c.5053A>G and c.5054C>T) are pathogenic and the two nonsynonymous variants indicated in
blue (c.4991T>C and c.5044G>A) are benign. (c) Distributions of estimated selection coefficients
|s| for nonsense, nonsynonymous, and synonmyous mutations. (d) Distributions of |s| for genes
expressed at low, medium, and high levels, based on tertiles of RNA-seq readcounts from Roadmap
Epigenomics data82, showing a positive correlation between expression level and |s| (Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.338; p < 10−15, two-tailed t-test).

Figure 4: Genes under “enhanced” or “relaxed” selection relative to the exome-wide LASSIE
model. (a) Number of potential missense mutations per gene (x-axis) vs. fold-change of the
observed number of rare missense mutations relative to the number expected under a PoissonBinomial
null model based on LASSIE (y-axis; see Methods). Each dot represents a single proteincoding
gene. Dots for genes showing significantly more rare variants than expected (“relaxed”;
n = 773) are colored red, whereas those for genes showing significantly fewer rare variants than
expected are colored blue (“enhanced”; n = 1118). (b) Groups of genes enriched for enhanced or
relaxed selection. Dots represent odds ratios of enrichment, with bars indicating 95% confidence
intervals. Genes under enhanced selection tend to be exclusively expressed in the central nervous
system or associated with autism spectrum disorder. In contrast, genes under relaxed selection tend
to be exclusively expressed in liver and skeletal muscle.
